The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance fr a private cpany. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrierâs liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance cpany representative.Conditions of CarriageAir transportation on Delta and the Delta ConnectionÂ® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage.

The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance fr a private cpany. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrierâs liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance cpany representative.Conditions of CarriageAir transportation on Delta and the Delta ConnectionÂ® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage.

The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrierâs liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.Conditions of CarriageAir transportation on Delta and the Delta ConnectionÂ® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example:â¢ Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.â¢ Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.â¢ Our right to change terms of the contract.â¢ Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.â¢ Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.â¢ Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight.These terms are incorporated by reference into our contract with you.

The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrierâs liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.Conditions of CarriageAir transportation on Delta and the Delta ConnectionÂ® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage.
