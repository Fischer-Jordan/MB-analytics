Our Tony Award® Nominees Nominated for Best PlayJaja's African Hair Braidingby Jocelyn BiohPhoto by Sara Krulwich, 2023 Broadway ProductionJaja’s African Hair Braiding in Harlem is a salon full of funny, whip-smart, talented women ready to make you look and feel nice nice. On this particularly muggy summer day, Jaja’s rule-following daughter Marie is running the shop while her mother prepares for her courthouse, green card wedding—to a man no one seems to particularly like. Just like her mother, DREAMer Marie is trying to secure her future; high school graduation is around the corner and all she wants to do is go to college. While Marie deals with the customers' and stylists' laugh-out-loud drama, news pierces the hearts of the women of the salon, galvanizing their connections and strengthening the community they have longed to make in the United States. Learn More Nominated for Best Revival of a PlayAppropriateby Branden Jacobs-JenkinsPhoto by 2NDSTAGE, 2023 Broadway ProductionEvery estranged member of the Lafayette clan has descended upon the crumbling Arkansas homestead to settle the accounts of the newly-dead patriarch. As his three adult children sort through a lifetime of hoarded mementos and junk, they collide over clutter, debt, and a contentious family history. But after a disturbing discovery surfaces among their father’s possessions, the reunion takes a turn for the explosive, unleashing a series of crackling surprises and confrontations. Learn More Did you know...Cabaret, nominated for Best Revival of a Musical, is based on I am a Camera?Set in 1930s Berlin, the play vividly portrays life in a tawdry rooming house, focusing on the complex character of Sally Bowles. Initially confident and flamboyant, Sally's vulnerability is gradually revealed as she faces illegal operations, failed attempts at rehabilitation, and fleeting romances. Mr. Isherwood serves as both narrator and confidant to Sally, offering a dispassionate yet empathetic perspective. Amidst Sally's journey, the play also touches on the plight of Jews in pre-WWII Germany, adding depth to the narrative.

"�� Can you crack this Uber problem?�� Can you crack this Uber problem? ALSO: How Yelp moderation works April 24, 2024 | Read Online Sponsored by Welcome back, Interview Masters!Today’s coding challenge will be a true test of your skills.In today’s newsletter, we’ll cover:Maximum Product SubarrayHow Yelp moderates inappropriate video contentRead time: under 5 minutes CODING CHALLENGEMaximum Product SubarrayMediumUberAmazonWayfairLinkedInGiven an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.Example 1:Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]Output: 6Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.Example 2:Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]Output: 0Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.Solve the problem here before reading the solution. SOLUTIONTo solve this problem, we will use Dynamic Programming. We'll maintain two variables: one for tracking the maximum product ending at the current index and another for tracking the minimum product ending at the current index. The maximum product can be obtained by multiplying a positive number with the maximum product or multiplying a negative number with the minimum product. That’s why we are keeping track of both.At each index, we update these two variables based on whether the current number is positive or negative. The maximum product can either be: The current number itself, Or the current number multiplied by the maximum product ending at the previous index, Or the current number multiplied by the minimum product ending at the previous index. Similarly, the minimum product can be:The current number itself, Or the current number multiplied by the maximum product ending at the previous index, Or the current number multiplied by the minimum product ending at the previous index.We also keep track of the overall maximum product seen so far and update it at each index.The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the nums array.

Learn More SYSTEM DESIGN EXPLAINEDModerating inappropriate video content at YelpSource: Yelp EngineeringYelp allows users to upload videos alongside reviews. To protect users from inappropriate content, Yelp uses a combination of AI and human moderators.An AI model analyzes uploaded videos and assigns a score. Videos exceeding a certain threshold are flagged for human review.The system prioritizes minimizing incorrect removals (false positives). Human reviewers assess flagged videos and restore any mistakes.Processing videos takes time, so Yelp uses techniques to reduce the load on the AI model. These include blocking repeat offenders and strategically selecting frames for analysis.Yelp leverages its existing photo moderation model to streamline video processing.

For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.Join us next week to find out the solution!

"How NOT to use GenAI as a developerWhen I first started using AI Assistants like Amazon Alexa, I was eager, enthusiastic… and a little naive.When I first started using AI Assistants like Amazon Alexa, I was eager, enthusiastic, …and a little naive. While I found that I could use it to check the weather or set my alarm, I soon found that some use cases — like asking it to shop for me — yielded concerning results, and were better off done myself. New technologies are exciting, but it takes time to learn how to use them effectively. Same goes for Generative AI. After months of learning how Generative AI didn't work, I finally got a hang of where it did. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot can immensely benefit developers, and using them in the workplace is only going to become more commonplace. I know that many folks are worried that AI will reduce the demand for developers, but the truth is this: in the AI-driven future, the only threat to your job is other developers who know how to use Generative AI — not Generative AI itself. If you don't feel like you've truly understood how to make the most out of Generative AI, an important step is learning where the boundaries of Gen AI use are (in other words, knowing when NOT to use it). Ultimately, Generative AI tools are not your guide or your teacher — you are instructing these tools on what to do. I'll start with some generative AI Do's and Don'ts, then expand on the why behind them.Hands-on Learning. Powered by AI. In addition to 1,000+ hands-on courses and projects, you'll get all of our AI-powered learning features, including: �� Instant Code Feedback �� AI-Powered Mock Interviews �️ Prompt Engineering Widgets�� Data Science & ML Skills Training⛓️ AI Courses & Projects (tinker with LLMs, LangChain, NLP, and more)Join 2M+ developers leveling up with EducativeLock In Your DiscountGenerative AI Do's and Dont's For both learning and work, here are some best practices for using Generative AI tools:Let it help you toward the destination, but don't let it drive It's impossible to memorize everything as a developer. Whether it’s documentation or online forums, turning to references for this type of information is just part of developer life. I rarely use a string split function, so every time I do, I have to look up the parameters I need for it. I end up copy-pasting code from a StackOverflow or Educative Answers page and editing it for my particular scenario. But now, I can now use AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard to provide me with quick references or code snippets. I still have to edit the code, but it saves me the time of browsing through a search engine's results. From research to debugging to documentation, developers are using Generative AI to save time doing various tedious tasks at work. The biggest use case is writing code. This was how 82.55% of developers reported using Generative AI in the recent Stack Overflow Developer Survey.As developers, writing code is the last step of our problem-solving process, which breaks down into 3 steps: Understanding a problemExploring and identifying potential solutionsImplementing that solution into codeThere's nothing wrong with using these AI tools to simplify our work, and writing code is a great place to start. What IS wrong though? We shouldn't be using Generative AI before the step of writing code. Note that the Generative AI use cases in the Stack Overflow survey speak nothing for the steps that come before writing code: understanding the problem, researching for any relevant context, and selecting a solution to the problem. Writing code only comes in for the very last problem-solving step, for which we can use AI under close supervision. We still have to review and edit the code output. Similarly, thinking of my last example of the string split function: I didn't use Generative AI to know whether I should use a string split function. Before I used AI, I spent my time independently evaluating my problem and my approach, only after which I asked the tool to complete a specific task for me. Bottom line: you should be guiding AI — not the other way around. AI tools are great assistants, but they can make mistakes on even the simplest tasks. AI lacks context and human creativity, and is no replacement for human judgment. Be wary of letting AI evaluate problems or select solutions for you. Because of AI's limitations, problem-solving will always be the role of the developer, and AI code will always need to be edited. (This is why beginner coders shouldn't try coding with Generative AI to code until they've mastered problem-solving and programming fundamentals on their own.)A peer, not an instructorAI is beneficial for so many daily tasks. These tools offer an excellent way to troubleshoot code, research, and even learn a new language. Instead of searching forums, you can ask AI to remind you of a particular syntax or way to implement a function. In a lot of ways, this is like having a well-prepared coworker or study buddy. But just like a human peer can make mistakes, so too may your AI assistant. And you should be cautious about leaning on AI to truly teach you. Why practice caution? Generative AI tools are unreliable for research. As you may know, Generative AI can hallucinate, meaning it can generate fictitious or inaccurate responses to prompts. The technology doesn't truly understand the content that it's generating, and often produces false statements with a tone of authority. It can even go so far as to reference fictitious events, sources, and citations. Generative AI is only predictively creating responses based on patterns it perceives in its training data. To add, Generative AI's training data is often outdated, which is never ideal for learning. Despite its shortcomings, AI has many benefits for learning. In a field that requires constant learning, AI can help streamline research, provide alternate explanations, and reduce some grunt work. Similar to how you'd turn to a peer or coworker, Generative AI can be a great tool for more low-stakes activities or responses that you can later verify yourself. For example: AnalogiesDebuggingAlternative explanations Mock oral exams (or mock interviews)But what I'm most excited about is AI's potential to make personalized learning more accessible than ever before. By adapting to students' needs in real-time, AI can customize learning in a way that's comparable to having a private tutor (and this is why we've added so many AI features to personalize our learning platform at Educative, from mock interviews to real-time feedback). This all said, you should be wary of using AI as a source of truth or research platform. Be sure to validate its responses and use it with healthy skepticism.One good way to mitigate risks of using AI as a learning tool is to use AI tools specifically created for learning programming. Specialized AI tools rely on models that are trained on the subject matter, optimized for the specific use case, and are thus also aware of their own limitations.Embracing generative AI toolsThe worst thing you can do for yourself as a developer is avoid using Generative AI (unless you're a total beginner, in which case I'd say you should wait). AI skills are in demand, and will continue to be prioritized in the future of software development. While I've largely talked about prompt engineering, learning to use Generative AI can mean many different things — ranging from OpenAI API integrations to building apps with tools that leverage LLMs. If you're struggling to get effective use out of Generative AI tools, I can assure you that you'll turn to them more enthusiastically once you hack how to use them effectively. Frustration will open up to more productivity and new opportunities. For the tasks where AI tools will save you time, you'll gain more time to think creatively, research comprehensively, and learn efficiently. I'm personally thrilled that we've embraced AI to strengthen developer learning at Educative, with features like: Instant code feedbackPrompt engineering widgetsAI-powered mock interviewsExplain with AI for alternative explanations of course contentYou can check out AI-powered learning with Educative here.

Amidst this backdrop, innovative solutions are being sought to provide relief and support, and one surprising but potent therapy is theatre. With its unique blend of creativity, collaboration, and expression, theatre stands out as a compelling method for alleviating anxiety and depression. Here, we explore how engaging in theatre—as an audience member or participant—can offer significant mental health benefits for teens and young adults.Expression and Catharsis: Theatre has a unique ability to provide a platform for expression and catharsis. Teens and Young adults, often navigating identity issues and emotional turmoil, can find a voice through participating in theatre. By acting out different roles, they are afforded a safe space to explore personal and societal issues, express feelings, and experiment with their identity. This process can be profoundly cathartic, allowing individuals to process complex emotions in a constructive and supportive environment.Connection and Community: The sense of community in theatre groups can significantly impact mental health. Theatre requires collaboration and communication, fostering a profound sense of belonging and shared purpose among its participants. For teens and young adults feeling isolated or disconnected, being part of a theatre group offers more than just a network of support and friendship. It provides a lifeline where they can feel understood and less alone. This community aspect can reduce feelings of loneliness and depression, which is crucial in an age where isolation is increasingly common.Empathy and Understanding: Theatre, a powerful tool for fostering empathy, not only benefits individuals but also has the potential to shape a more compassionate society. Actors gain a deeper understanding of different perspectives and human experiences by stepping into another's shoes. This increased empathy can lead to a profound shift in how we relate to others, fostering greater compassion and interpersonal skills and reducing prejudices and social anxiety. For teens and young adults, this broadening of perspective can enhance personal and social development, aiding in emotional maturity and the ability to navigate complex social environments.Mindfulness and Presence: Engaging in theatre can be a mindful practice, requiring present-moment awareness and concentration. For performers, the need to be in the moment and responsive can enhance focus and reduce the prevalence of ruminative thoughts, a common issue in anxiety disorders. Audiences, too, benefit from the immersive experience that theatre provides, offering a break from digital distractions and the stress of daily life.Skill Development and Confidence: Participation in theatre can build various skills, including public speaking, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. Developing these skills can boost self-esteem and confidence, which are directly linked to mental well-being. For many teens and young adults, increased confidence in their abilities can mitigate feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, which are common in depressive disorders.Evidence and Real-World Applications: Research supports the mental health benefits of theatre. A study by the British Journal of Psychiatry found that engaging in cultural activities like theatre can lower rates of anxiety and depression in individuals. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches like drama therapy have been recognized by the North American Drama Therapy Association for their effectiveness in treating individuals with mental health issues. Real-world applications are numerous. Schools and universities are increasingly incorporating theatre programs in their mental health initiatives. Community centers and non-profits offer theatre workshops aimed at vulnerable populations, including teens and young adults at risk of mental health disorders.Theatre can be a powerful tool in addressing the mental health crisis among many teens and young adults. Theatre offers a multifaceted approach to enhancing mental well-being through its capacity for emotional expression, community building, skill development, and mindfulness. While it is not a panacea for all mental health issues, its inclusion in broader mental health strategies can provide significant benefits. It should be considered by educators, therapists, parents, and policymakers alike.As society grapples with the growing mental health challenges facing teens and young adults, the creative and immersive world of theatre offers more than just an escape—it provides healing, connection, and a deeper understanding of the human condition, proving its worth as a valuable ally in mental health advocacy.Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

"� If you can't solve this coding problem...� If you can't solve this coding problem... ALSO: How Discord uses code-splitting April 10, 2024 | Read Online Welcome back, Interview Masters!We’ll do one of the most asked coding problems this week.In today’s newsletter, we’ll cover:Maximum Subarray problemHow Discord boosts performance with code-splittingRead time: under 4 minutes CODING CHALLENGEMaximum SubarrayMediumTikTokAppleAmazonMicrosoftGiven an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.Example 1:Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]Output: 6Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.Example 2:Input: nums = [1]Output: 1Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.Example 3:Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]Output: 23Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.Solve the problem here before reading the solution. SOLUTIONTo solve this problem, we can use Kadane's algorithm. It's a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of the maximum sum subarray ending at each position in the array. If the maximum sum of subarray ending at the current_index-1 is negative, we should start a new subarray with the current element. Otherwise, we should extend the maximum sum subarray ending at current_index-1.The overall maximum sum subarray will be the maximum among all the maximum sum subarrays ending at each index.The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the nums array.

SYSTEM DESIGN EXPLAINEDHow Discord boosts performance with code-splittingDiscord maintains app performance by using code-splitting and lazy loading. Code-splitting reduces the amount of code that needs to load at once. This makes the app load faster and use less memory. Lazy loading means that parts of the app only load when they are needed. This reduces the amount of time it takes to load the app initially. You can dive deeper here.

"Reflections on community, compiler to AST, and radios 03 April Welcome to ISSUE #222 of The Overflow! This newsletter is by developers, for developers, written and curated by the Stack Overflow team and Cassidy Williams. This week: the data costs of observability, the legal consequences of not understanding your Miranda rights, and the benefits of scripting in the primary project language. From the blog Is AI making your code worse? stackoverflow.blogBen and Ryan are joined by Bill Harding, CEO of GitClear, for a discussion of AI-generated code quality and its impact on productivity. GitClear’s research has highlighted the fact that while AI can suggest valid code, it can’t necessarily reuse and modify existing code—a recipe for long-term challenges in maintainability and test coverage if devs are too dependent on AI code-gen tools.Controlling cloud costs: Where to start, and where to go from there promotionIn this episode, Ben and Ryan are joined by Joshua Fox, a senior cloud architect at DoiT, to discuss cloud cost optimization. They explore the importance of controlling and understanding cloud costs, the role of good architecture in cost optimization, and strategies for dealing with surprise costs.Community products: Reflections and looking ahead stackoverflow.blogThis past year, we’ve explored and learned how AI can support the community on Stack Overflow and across the Stack Exchange network. Read more to see our reflections and learn more about the initiatives our product team is prioritizing this year.Data, data everywhere and not a stop to think stackoverflow.blogBen and Ryan are joined by Nick Heudecker, Senior Director of Market Strategy and Competitive Intelligence at Cribl, to discuss the state of data and analytics. They cover GenAI, the role of incumbents vs. startups, challenges of data storage and security, data quality and ETL pipelines, measures of data quality for GenAI, and Cribl’s role in the data and observability space.Build your app in Python, natively on Algorand with AlgoKit promotionAlgorand is an enterprise-grade, programmable layer-1 protocol you can trust, now with a programming language you know. Build in Python on Algorand today with AlgoKit, your comprehensive toolset, and explore a real blockchain experience. Save time, save money, and save your sanity.

"can you crack Apple interview?can you crack Apple interview? Your weekly coding challenge April 03, 2024 | Read Online Sponsored by Welcome back, Interview Masters!We hope you’re ready for the coding challenge of this week.In today’s newsletter, we’ll cover:Best time to buy and sell stock - asked by Apple!What happens when you type google . com on your browser?Read time: under 4 minutes CODING CHALLENGEBest time to buy and sell stockEasyAppleAmazonMicrosoftYou are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.Example 1:Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]Output: 5Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.Example 2:Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]Output: 0Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.Solve the problem here before reading the solution. SOLUTIONTo maximize profit, we need to find the maximum difference between two elements in the array such that the larger element appears after the smaller element. This essentially means finding the lowest valley followed by the highest peak in the array.We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum price seen so far. Then, for each element, we calculate the profit if we were to sell on that day (current price minus minimum price seen so far). If this profit is greater than the current maximum profit, we update the maximum profit.The time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the prices list.

SYSTEM DESIGN EXPLAINEDWhat happens when you type google . com on your browser?When you type a URL in your browser and press enter, first the browser translates the domain name (google . com) to an IP address using a directory called DNS (Domain Name System).Then, the browser establishes a secure connection with the server using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).The browser sends a request to the server specifying what action to take. For google . com, the action might be to submit a search or view a webpage. The server processes the request and sends back a response containing the requested data. This response often includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The browser interprets the response and displays the webpage. To dive deeper, read the full article here.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps us manage this abundance of unstructured data and make sense of our modern digital landscape. For engineers looking to future-proof their skillset, acquiring a working knowledge of NLP is a great way to stay competitive in today's data-driven world.The goal of NLP is to make machines understand our spoken and written languages. Many of us actually interact with NLP every day and may not even realize it — Virtual Assistants (VAs), such as Google Assistant, Cortana, Alexa, and Siri, are largely NLP systems. NLP is a highly complex field due to the intricate relationship between words and semantics. This complexity is compounded by the unique grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of each language. Machine Learning plays a crucial role in NLP by enabling machines to perform these tasks effectively across various languages.This week, we released two new NLP courses:�� Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow�� Transformers for Natural Language ProcessingThese hands-on courses are fantastic primers for anyone looking to build some basic NLP skills. In Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow, you'll use Python and Keras to interface with TensorFlow, a popular library used for Machine Learning and AI. By the end, you will have a solid foundation in NLP with the skills to build TensorFlow-based solutions for a wide range of NLP problems. Transformers for Natural Language Processing is a great way to get hands-on with transformer models — a fundamental technology behind modern NLPs. Learn how to fine-tune transformers, train models from scratch, and learn to use powerful APIs. Work with large datasets from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and more.Attention head of a transformer's layer The foundational concept behind transformers is token mixing. Transformers relate each token to every other token in a sequence, rather than analyzing them sequentially.

The theatre is a human experience, and humanity is diverse. It brings varied perspectives, enriches narratives, and connects with a broader audience. Achieving diversity in theatre programs, especially in educational settings, requires intentional strategies and a commitment to inclusion. Here’s a guide for educators and directors on how to embrace a more diverse and inclusive theatre program.Conduct an Honest Assessment Begin with an honest evaluation of your current program. Who is being represented on stage, and whose stories are being told? Who is missing? Consider not only ethnic and racial diversity but also gender, sexual orientation, disability, and socioeconomic status. This assessment can help identify areas for growth and set a benchmark for progress.Revise Your CurriculumIncorporate plays and musicals that reflect a variety of cultures, experiences, and perspectives. This doesn't mean you should only select works written by or about underrepresented groups; it means balancing the classics with contemporary works that speak to a diverse society. Additionally, educating students on the history of diverse theatre movements can inspire and inform their practice.Outreach and RecruitmentExpanding your outreach efforts can attract students from various backgrounds. Consider partnering with community organizations, schools, and social groups that work with underrepresented populations. Offer workshops or free performances to introduce theatre to a wider audience. In recruitment, emphasize the importance of diversity in your materials and messages, showing that all are welcome and valued.Foster an Inclusive EnvironmentCreating a welcoming environment where all students feel safe and valued is crucial. This includes establishing clear policies against discrimination and harassment, facilitating open discussions about diversity and inclusion, and encouraging students to share their experiences and perspectives. Such an environment not only nurtures diversity but also creativity and empathy.Provide Mentorship and SupportMentorship can play a pivotal role in supporting students from underrepresented groups. Pairing students with mentors who share similar backgrounds or experiences can offer guidance, encouragement, and a sense of belonging. Additionally, providing scholarships or financial assistance can help remove barriers to participation for students from low-income families.Encourage Diverse CastingPractice inclusive casting by selecting actors based on their talent and suitability for the role rather than their physical appearance unless specific characteristics are essential to the part. Avoid typecasting and give all students the opportunity to explore a range of characters and stories.Engage in Continuous LearningStay informed about best practices for diversity and inclusion in theatre education. Attend workshops, join professional organizations, and engage in conversations with colleagues about creating more inclusive programs. Diversity is a dynamic concept, and strategies for inclusion can evolve over time.Measure Progress and AdaptRegularly review your program’s diversity goals and assess progress. Solicit feedback from students, staff, and the community to understand the impact of your efforts and identify areas for improvement. Be willing to adapt your strategies to meet the changing needs of your community and the broader societal context.Enhancing diversity in theatre programs is an ongoing journey that enriches the educational experience for all students and fosters a more inclusive and empathetic society. By taking intentional steps and committing to continuous improvement, educators and directors can create a theatre program that truly reflects the diversity of the human experience. Let's embrace this challenge with open hearts and minds, recognizing that the beauty of theatre lies in its power to tell every story.ShareSonia Friedman: Leadership changes are a chance for an industry-wide shake-up by Matthew Hemley, The Stage | Sonia Friedman has hailed the �giant sea change” the industry finds itself in as a chance for the new leaders of various theatres to �shake the whole thing up.” Read...The 24th Annual WhatsOnStage Awards: full list of winners by Tom Millward, WhatsOnStage | The 2024 victors have been crowned!

"The truth behind 2024 layoffs: 4 tips to stay aheadAre layoffs the new normal? I was working as a SWE at Microsoft when they announced their first-ever layoffs in January 2009...I was working as a software engineer at Microsoft when they announced their first-ever layoffs in January 2009. For days after, we still didn't know who was affected for certain. Even the tiniest thing, like my colleague's badge not working on campus, or email taking too long to load, was excruciating. As an early-career employee on an H-1B visa with a new family, the stakes felt even higher. Uncertainty is never easy. And after another turbulent year in 2023, we have unfortunately already seen another round of tech layoffs in the first weeks of 2024. While we hoped most companies were done with layoffs, things don't look so rosy. Plus, with heightened anxiety around AI impacting the tech industry, the future seems muddier than ever. Today I want to talk about the causes and implications of these layoffs, and what you can do to minimize your chances of being affected — but bounce back quickly if you are. We'll cover:�� Are layoffs the new normal?�� What to expect in 2024 and beyond��️ 4 tips for weathering the storm�� Staying one step ahead of the industryAre layoffs the new normal?Many of the factors that are contributing to layoffs aren't anything new. For instance:Rebalancing post-pandemic hiring: Leveling back out after the pandemic's tech hiring rush.IRS Section 174: A US tax section concerning research and development (R&D) expenses that's undergone significant changes. Just a few of those changes mean that companies now 1) must claim software development costs as R&D expenses, and 2) can no longer deduct R&D costs as an expense.Cost vs. Profit Center: A growing prioritization over departments that are profit centers, directly contributing to revenue, rather than operational cost centers.Renewed interest in creating profitable businesses and products: Companies and investors are prioritizing projects that demonstrate clear profitability and sustainability.Higher interest rates: This trend is continuing, meaning free money is not readily available to invest in potential ideas that may or may not pan out.VC slowdown: Venture capital (VC) funding is slowing down, which has a significant impact on tech startups and smaller companies.All of these factors have posed financial constraints and challenges for small and large companies alike. And just because we turned the page on a new year, it doesn't mean they're really going away. That said, inflation is not nearly as bad as it was last year either. So it is a bit jarring that in the first four weeks of 2024, top tech companies from Salesforce to Microsoft to Amazon laid off another 25,000 employees. In a way, it seems that layoffs in tech may even be considered the new normal — in no small part because they seem to be rewarding Wall Street, at least in the short term. In a recent NPR article, Jeff Shulman, professor at University of Washington’s Foster School of Business, noted that layoffs seem to be helping their stock prices, so these companies see no reason to stop.1 While it's a chilling thought for tech industry workers, it's likely that we will see layoffs occur throughout the year. We can only hope they won't grow to be as severe as last year. We also have to take notice of the elephant in the room. Every month, Generative AI is improving and becoming more entrenched in the industry. Our existing services are rapidly seeing AI integrations, as companies big and small (including outside the tech industry) are looking to take advantage of GenAI’s power.With these developments in mind, it's hard not to worry that recent layoffs are fueled at least in part by AI anxiety. However, while AI is going to play a huge role in what we can expect for the future, it's reasonable to say that AI isn't the main culprit for layoffs this year. That said, AI is poised to be a massive catalyst for transformation — which means that every developer should adopt some basic AI skills to stay ahead of the curve. So now let’s explore how the coming months and years may look for the tech industry.What to expect in 2024 and beyondReshuffling of engineering resourcesCompanies are focusing more on AI initiatives and hiring more for AI. Developers with the right skills will join new AI initiatives within their companies, and others will be hired externally to new teams. This doesn't mean that only developers who are prepared to join AI initiatives will be in demand. Often, companies will still need to fill the roles they've left behind. But they may have fewer open roles for junior developers, for example. This means competition will be higher across the board. The reason why is linked to the next point. ��Increased expectations to leverage AIAI will disrupt jobs. This is almost a guarantee. However, in my opinion, most of those affected jobs will be outside the software engineering industry. That said, junior developer roles and semi-technical roles will see a change in their workflows, emphasizing efficiency and reduction of tedium, which may result in increased competition. Since many technical tasks can be semi-automated, modern workflows will see a combination of AI and humans taking on essential tasks together. A prime example of this would be by using thin wrappers around LLMs like OpenAI. It's not hard to imagine how a junior developer or data analyst can leverage this in their work. Consider a thin wrapper for financial analysis on top of OpenAI API. A data analyst can use the wrapper to generate a financial report. Leveraging this thin wrapper can mean the difference between a team of 5 data analysts generating a report monthly, and one analyst generating that report in one day. In this way, leveraging AI will lead to downsizing, but we still need human employees to guide and supervise the AI tools in use. Thin wrappers are not plug-and-play solutions. We still need a human in the driver's seat prompting, guiding, and modifying the LLM's output to their desired result. This means that the most in-demand candidates will not only have the right expertise for their current role; they will bring the skills and ingenuity required to leverage AI APIs and models to both streamline their workflows and build the next generation of AI-enhanced products and applications. Some fields and products are falling out of favorCompanies and investors will continue freeing up resources and cutting down in areas that haven't been historically profitable or sustainable. Meanwhile, certain products and services may see a decline as well. For instance, Amazon Alexa might see more layoffs. Alexa's AI just isn't that impressive, relative to other publicly available assistants. It has historically struggled with giving intelligent answers. If I have to buy an assistant for accuracy, I would personally prefer a home assistant with Open AI, or Google Home with BARD. Alexa is fine for asking for weather and setting up timers, but there's a reason most people aren't using Alexa to place online orders. Amazon has yet to find a way to generate and grow Alexa. Even after much hype, I don't see Alexa becoming a great B2B business with more integration into hotel rooms, conference rooms, and cars. Other companies and products may also see pressure to find buyers or do more reconciliation, e.g. as with home fitness startups like Tonal and Peloton, or health kit devices. If you're in any of these companies and fields (or related ones), I certainly hope that you won't be affected. But personally, I'd rather be more cautiously prepared than complacent.4 tips for weathering the storm The reality is that nothing is certain. We have no idea how many more layoffs await us in the coming year, or what new disruptions await — but we can certainly expect more belt-tightening to continue. Here are four steps you can take to optimally prepare yourself for whatever happens.1) Keep a close eye on your desired career path.Uncertainty aside, you probably have an idea of the next milestones you want to hit. Maybe it's jumping into a new career path or specialization (like game development or freelance web development) — or perhaps it’s moving into a more senior role, or becoming a manager. Whatever it is, don't lose sight of those goals… but don’t be afraid if the road to get there seems a little hazy. Your desired career path could see considerable disruption and/or evolution. New AI tools will be coming into use, competition will increase, and more specialized skill sets could grow in demand. Whatever happens, keep a finger on the pulse of developments in your desired field or roles, and be ready to learn new skills so you can stay ahead of the curve. The goal is to remain more proactive than reactive.2) Have a plan.Dealing with uncertainty can be disorienting. But it’s exactly in times of uncertainty that having a plan (or plans) becomes even more critical. If you haven't been laid off, but you're anxious about the possibility, it's helpful to mitigate any stress by thinking several steps ahead. For example, hash out the whole scenario of a potential layoff and identify your next steps — whether those steps are financial, logistical, or interpersonal. (Importantly, write the plan down; in the event that you do get laid off, chances are you may feel too scattered to remember them clearly.)If you've already experienced a layoff, I'm sorry to hear it, and you're in good company. That said, a plan can help you, too. Bouncing back after a layoff isn't so different from a usual job hunt plan, but right now, you should be adding some extra steps. For instance, learning AI skills, resuming in-person networking, and starting interview prep would be especially helpful (more on the latter in just a moment).3) Be almost ready for interviews.The best way to reduce interview-related anxiety is to be almost ready for interviews at all times. This is especially important if you're in one of those areas that's more likely to be laid off or reshuffled. Of course, if you are laid off, preparing for interviews becomes your full-time job, so this tip is more so for those who still have their jobs. You don't have to be fully prepared for interviews, but you should be in a state where you'd be in good shape if you had an interview coming in a couple of weeks. Brush up on coding interview patterns, system design, or other table stakes concepts typically discussed in engineering interviews. If you find you have some cobwebs to dust off, it's best to take care of those knowledge gaps now rather than later. Remember: interviewing is a skill that can be practiced just like any other skill. How you prepare for interviews is the one element of the hiring process that you can fully control. Take advantage of the opportunity.4) Start learning AI.It’s 2024, which means that every tech company is investing heavily in AI initiatives — and looking for the right talent to get them there. If you intend to remain indispensable with your current skill set, you will have to learn to work with AI. Every software engineer should get comfortable with AI to some degree. This could mean as much as learning machine learning and data science to work with models directly. It could mean as little as getting your feet wet with OpenAI API integrations. It could also mean learning frameworks like LangChain to develop applications leveraging LLMs. For everyone else, learning some prompt engineering best practices certainly can’t hurt. There will be heightened urgency for those who want to stay competitive in junior or semi-technical roles to leverage AI tools in order to work more efficiently. There will also be numerous opportunities for data scientists, ML engineers, and AI developers with the skills and experience to lead the AI paradigm shift. Knowing AI will only benefit you. In fact, you could argue that it already gives you an unfair advantage in today's market. If you're familiar with AI and get laid off, it’s possible you could still get a new job at the same company (I have heard crazier stories).Staying one step ahead of the industryThere’s a lot of legitimate anxiety around tech layoffs. However, it's important to remember that we publicize bad news more than good news. Nobody publishes articles about big tech hiring engineers, but they do publish layoff updates. Here are three important things to remember: A lot of people lose their jobs everyday, but more people find jobs everydayYour skills ARE transferable, even if you lost your last roleFocusing on growing your skill set is never a bad investment at any phase of your careerThat said, we will likely hear about more layoffs to come. But we don't have to be cynical about it. I know it's easier said than done — but if anything, try to let the news add a level of urgency to your ambitions. In times of uncertainty, it is important to control the things we can control. In this case, that means taking action to future-proof our skillset. I hope the tips I shared today were helpful. But I especially hope you don't delay learning AI skills. AI is not going away anytime soon, so we have to embrace it. In an upcoming newsletter, I'll share the top AI skills you should learn (and in what order) to be job-ready in today's tech climate. In the meantime, here are some courses I recommend for the skills we discussed today:All You Need to Know About Prompt EngineeringBecome a Machine Learning EngineerGenerative AI: From Theory to Product LaunchAbove all, keep doing excellent work, keep upskilling, and keep an eye on what's happening in the industry.

However, casting decisions can sometimes lead to drama, upset students, and concerned parents. As a theatre teacher, navigating these situations is essential to ensuring a positive and enriching experience for everyone involved. To guarantee a smooth sailing audition process from start to finish, explore the following strategies to help you make casting decisions, best practices to address upset students (and their parents), and ways to foster a supportive theatrical environment.Casting DecisionsBalancing Artistic Vision and Fairness: Casting a production is a complex process that requires the consideration of numerous factors, including talent, suitability for roles, chemistry among actors, and artistic vision. To navigate casting drama, follow these steps:Transparency: Clearly communicate your casting criteria to students and parents before auditions. This will manage expectations and minimize misunderstandings later. Unsure where to start? We recommend checking out this guide to help you survive and thrive in this creative and dynamic role.Audition Process: Conduct auditions in a fair and objective manner. Use a standardized rubric to evaluate students’ performances, focusing on skills and suitability for roles rather than personal biases.Open-Mindedness: Remain open to unexpected choices. Sometimes, an actor might bring a unique interpretation to a character, enhancing the production.Callbacks: Use callback auditions to narrow choices and consider actors in different roles. This provides a chance to explore different dynamics among potential cast members.Feedback: Offer constructive feedback to students who did not receive the roles they desired. Encourage them to continue developing their skills and auditioning for future productions.Addressing Upset StudentsIt is natural for some students to feel disappointed if they do not get the role they want. Here is how you can handle upset students:Private Conversations: If a student is visibly upset, arrange a private conversation to discuss their feelings. Allow them to express their emotions and concerns openly.Empathy: Show empathy and understanding. Acknowledge their disappointment and remind them that casting decisions do not reflect their worth or talent. Highlight Strengths: Emphasize their strengths and areas of improvement. Encourage them to view the experience as a chance to grow further and develop their skills.Alternative Opportunities: Suggest other ways they can contribute to the production, such as assisting with backstage tasks, set design, understudying roles, or being in the ensemble.Handling Concerned ParentsParental concerns are another aspect that requires careful navigation. Consider these tips on how you can address them:Open Communication: Maintain an open line of communication with parents from the beginning. Share information about the audition process, casting choices, and the importance of fostering a positive environment.Explain the Process: If parents express concern about casting decisions, explain the audition and casting process in detail. Emphasize that decisions are made based on the needs of the production.Focus on Growth: Assure parents that their child’s growth and learning are paramount. Share specific examples of how their child can benefit from the experience, regardless of the role they received.Encourage Support: Encourage parents to support their child’s involvement and passion for theatre, regardless of the role. Remind them that every role contributes to the overall success of the production.Fostering a Supportive Theatrical EnvironmentTo minimize casting drama and promote a positive atmosphere, consider these practices:Team Building: Organize team-building activities at the start of rehearsals. This helps cast members bond, fostering a supportive and collaborative environment.Clear Expectations: Set clear expectations for behavior and professionalism. Emphasize the importance of mutual respect among cast members.Positive Reinforcement: Recognize and celebrate all cast members' hard work and accomplishments throughout the rehearsal process.Inclusive Approach: Consider rotating roles or double casting for certain productions. This approach can provide more students with opportunities to shine.As a theatre teacher, navigating casting drama and addressing upset students and parents is a vital skill. By approaching casting decisions with transparency, empathy, and professionalism, you can create an environment where students feel valued, supported, and empowered to grow as performers. Remember, every role contributes to the magic of the production, and your guidance plays a crucial role in shaping the positive experiences of your students.Pledge your supportIf you liked this post from The Scene, why not share it?

"☸️ Kubernetes is distancing from Docker. Here’s what that means for devs.Learning Kubernetes & Docker, and knowing how they evolved together and moved apart, is key for any dev building scalable applications. In 2020, it was announced that Kubernetes was deprecating support for Dockershim. In the years since, Kubernetes has been steadily distancing itself from Docker since they occupy such a similar space in the market. Now Kubernetes seems well on its way to removing Docker as a whole. Before you get alarmed, this isn't as catastrophic as it initially sounds. You will still be able to use Docker in other ways that are relevant to Kubernetes (more on that in a moment). However, you will not be able to use Docker as the container runtime underneath Kubernetes. In the past, Kubernetes and Docker were deeply intertwined, with Docker being the preferred container runtime and Kubernetes seamlessly managing these Docker containers. Therefore a separation between the two is still a big deal. (At the end of this newsletter I’ll share my predictions for how this trend will affect the enterprise development industry). Above all, a solid grasp of Kubernetes and Docker, coupled with an understanding of how they evolved together (and then moved apart), is important for any developer hoping to build scalable applications. And if you are interested in building your own product, you will want to have a firm understanding of the scale at which it will be necessary to leverage tools like Docker and Kubernetes. (Here at Educative, we had millions of users before we made the move to Kubernetes — but every product is different). If you want to develop a solid foundation with Docker and Kubernetes, take a look at The Beginners Guide to Docker or A Practical Guide to Kubernetes, as well as our curated learning path Kubernetes Essentials. Remember that these tools are complex at heart, so I highly recommend starting with the basics to familiarize yourself with the software. Today let’s start by unpacking the history of these two revolutionary technologies and try to explain how we got to the present moment — which may give us some clues about where enterprise-scale applications are headed in the coming years.Become a DevOps Pro If you are interested in DevOps, check out our interactive course:The DevOps Toolkit CatalogYou will start by covering Kubernetes services with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud with Terraform as the main management tools. You’ll move on to serverless deployment and discuss pros and cons of such techniques. By the end of this course, you’ll have received plenty of hands-on practice and exposure to multiple essential DevOps processes and services.Start LearningUnpacking the history between Kubernetes & DockerAbout a decade ago, software development as we knew it was completely transformed. A new system of organizing and deploying modern applications was born from two unglamorous tools. What followed was a new generation of extremely complex and globally distributed systems — the foundation of all modern software applications. The process of building new software, otherwise known as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), used to be a slow and tedious practice. Issues arose in each phase of a software’s life cycle related to deployment, scaling, management, and consistency. To address these problems, the tech community collaborated to create what is known as containerization platforms. A key aspect of these platforms was the implementation of what we know as containers– a lightweight system of organization. With these applications in play, developers finally had a consistent and portable environment to run any software on any machine. Going a step further, developers searched for a way to organize these containers. From this newfound portability, container orchestration platforms arose. Now it was possible to not only universally run applications but deploy and manage them as well. As a result, shipping and scaling software became seemingly limitless due to these new tools: Docker and Kubernetes. No matter what role you occupy in the field of software development and IT, familiarity with these tools can give you a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.For developers: Kubernetes and Docker equip you with a space to build platforms in a neat and organized fashion. In turn, taking on more challenging and complex projects is more accessible. If you aren’t familiar with this software yet, check out our Docker for Developers Course to master it now.For IT teams and managers: these cost-efficient tools provide you with unwavering assistance, logistical support, and maximized availability– saving valuable time and resources. Kubernetes and Docker bring a new level of scalability and productivity to development. Let’s break down each technology in depth.What is Docker?Docker was the first containerization platform of its kind, originating from Docker Inc. in March of 2013. This software singlehandedly revolutionized how we build, transport, and run modern applications. (Fun fact: the name Docker was inspired by the term used at shipping docks for containers that fit neatly on ships, trucks, and trains). Much like these shipping docks, Docker introduced a way in which applications can be �packaged” into containers, allowing for easy and consistent deployment. The Docker project quickly gained traction, attracting contributors and forming a community that further propelled its development and evolution. Built on Linux containers, the platform’s reliability and speed noticeably aided the software lifecycle process for developers. Docker containers serve as isolated environments with no external dependencies. This means that software packaged inside a container can run across various environments including virtual machines, personal laptops, or even cloud providers. This was notably revolutionary, as the portability of containers created opportunities for cloud-based app development. It was now easier than ever to run programs on lots of different operating systems– hardware and software. The tool is versatile, helping developers run and package their applications smoothly. In essence, Docker makes it extremely easy to leverage Linux containers to package applications in a simple format known as Docker file. You can quickly send your software out into the world and have it up and running in no time — it's like a fast-track delivery service. To this day, Docker software continues to grow in complexity and impact our industry in a multitude of ways. At its heart though, it is just a set of configurations and scripts. Now that we have our neatly organized containers with Docker, it’s time to get some management on board. This is where our orchestrator comes into play.What is Kubernetes?Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is the go-to container orchestration platform, widely recognized for its power and versatility in the realm of software development. It's a popular tool, generally due to its flexibility and the fact that it's open-source. It’s important to note that the software internally requires Docker containers (or a similar alternative). The platform originated from an internal Google project and was announced to the public in June 2014. Kubernetes took off rapidly, attracting a global community of developers and organizations. It quickly became the gold standard for container orchestration, providing an efficient way to deploy, scale, and manage applications in a cloud-native and scalable manner. The software is praised for its portability, efficiency, and rapidly growing ecosystem. Today, Kubernetes is a fundamental technology in the world of cloud computing and modern software development, enabling efficient management of containerized applications across various infrastructures. The success of Kubernetes remains to be a significant turning point in the world of software development. Like any technology, Kubernetes has its strengths and weaknesses. Due to its complex architecture, Kubernetes comes with a fairly significant learning curve — it can be hard to get started completely without any prior knowledge. I recommend checking out our Practical Guide to Kubernetes to equip yourself with the skills to use this tool before diving in.Docker & Kubernetes Use Cases In an ideal, large-scale production environment, Kubernetes and Docker are both at play. In tandem, these two systems create the optimal environment for DevOp engineers. One helps organize the plans while the other ensures smooth sailing. When considering these software on their own, it may be worth noting the separate use cases of the two. As an orchestrator, Kubernetes doesn’t exist without a container tool such as Docker already in play. If I had to build a brand new service right now, implementing Kubernetes and Docker right off the bat may be overkill given the added complexity and amount of up-front work required. It makes way more sense to deploy small applications on a handful of servers rather than deal with the burden of implementing an orchestration software. Unless you are dealing with an enterprise-scale application, you probably don’t need the uptime optimization that Docker and Kubernetes provide. However, as a business grows, so does the amount of tedious, redundant work. These small annoyances add up, and eventually it will become time to invest in Kubernetes and Docker. Otherwise, your technical debt will grow and it’ll be a heavy lift. When quick recovery, frequent upgrades, and scalability become critical for the business, it’s imperative to have these tools. Don’t let technical debt get prohibitively expensive!Top Docker & Kubernetes AlternativesOf course, there are other tools and services out there that help manage containers. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is comparable to Kubernetes in that it works alongside Docker. Amazon ECS organizes containers into logical groupings known as clusters. Whereas Kubernetes uses pods and deployments, Amazon uses task definitions. These are comparable to blueprints that specify which Docker images to use, how to link containers, and which resources to allocate. Docker Swarm – not to be confused with our handy containerization platform Docker – is another orchestration tool. Docker Swarm was built by the Docker team, allowing it to integrate seamlessly with Docker commands and workflows. Though Kubernetes is more comprehensive and powerful, Docker Swarm is a much simpler platform to utilize. However, Docker Swarm never had the success they hoped for. Docker open-sourced Swarm, hoping it would become an enterprise-scale business. But since Kubernetes had already launched for free and been open-sourced by Google, it was cemented as the industry standard. Docker has been struggling since to find its niche as a scalable enterprise business. An alternative to Docker is Podman. Advertised as safer, this containerization tool has some key differences. Firstly, this utility is considered more secure on the basis of being �rootless, i.e. it can run and manage containers without requiring superuser privileges. This is known to have security benefits, such as minimizing the risk of breaches and container breakouts. Additionally, many consider Podman a favorable tool in terms of ease of use. Simply put, it might just be the easier option for developers. The Docker team is busy working on ways to make software deployment better and more accessible. However, they remain struggling with no solid option for an enterprise-scale business.What is the future of containerization?Moving forward, I expect that Kubernetes will remain the most popular container orchestration platform despite its changing support for Docker. Its robust ecosystem makes it a favorable option, as does the positive attention it has received from the tech community. Undoubtedly, Kubernetes will continue to make developing enterprise-scale applications a smoother process. It'll become even better at managing programs not just on one computer, but all over the place, like in the cloud and on special devices. Unless other larger cloud providers like Amazon succeed in recreating and/or improving upon Kubernetes, significant changes are unlikely. As for Docker, some suggest it will become even more equipped to work with container orchestration platforms to secure a more simplified development process. In order to compete with alternatives such as Podman, Docker will hopefully become a more secure tool, so everyone can use it without fear of breaches. And what about Kubernetes reducing support for Docker as a container runtime? It's not uncommon to see minor features deprecated as a way to optimize performance and consistency, but I suspect that Kubernetes, and the larger open-source Google community, are trying to hedge their bets against Docker. With a for-profit organization backing the containerization tool, it is clear that they need some way to make a profit, and the service that Kubernetes provides is an easy target. However, as Kubernetes and Docker carve out their unique paths, there is no doubt that they will each continue to play pivotal roles in shaping the landscape of software development and deployment, steering the industry towards efficient and secure application management. If you do want to improve your Docker and Kubernetes knowledge, we do have a handful of hands-on courses here at Educative covering a range of skill levels.

In our quest to offer unparalleled insights on all things theatre education, we've turned to woodworker and theatre educator Anthony Arena for his insight. Familiar to many through his YouTube channel, �Simple Stagecraft,” Anthony has emerged as a beacon of accessible technical theatre wisdom and resources. We last spoke with Anthony just over a year ago to discover how Simple Stagecraft's videos illuminate the intricate realms of technical theatre, rendering them accessible resources for theatre educators and students alike. We spoke with Anthony again this week to seek his expertise and guidance on how theatre teachers and directors can expertly nurture, expand, and grow their student designers and technicians’ crew. The following has been edited for length and clarity.THE SCENE: What core qualities and skill sets should high school students possess to become valuable technicians and designers?ANTHONY: The most significant thing, and I mean a good 80% of what makes an ideal technical theatre student, is eagerness and initiative. Technical skills can almost always be taught; soft skills like communication and leadership will come with time. Having a student who is eager enough, whether through a drive for success or pure excitement, to always take the initiative in their work and always be ahead of you, looking at that next step, is absolute gold. A good technician can follow instructions well and think for themselves. A great technician explains the instructions that they believe will work best moving forward. Eagerness and initiative are by no means something that a student should innately possess for the first job they are given, though. It is your job to help find a role for them about which they feel that sense of eagerness, though, of course, some students won’t quite get to that level no matter what job they have, and that is perfectly fine as well.THE SCENE: In your experience, what strategies or team-building activities have you found effective in fostering a sense of camaraderie among your crew members?ANTHONY: It can be challenging for some teachers and directors to take time away from their actors. Still, suppose you are the sole teacher of a program or both director and technical director of a production. In that case, it is imperative that your technicians and designers feel just as important as your actors. If you are in the role of an educator, news flash they are just as important. Each student, whether they are the lead carrying the show and perhaps the whole department or a student in one of your classes who helps paint a set in class one time, is a student to whom you are responsible for presenting the world of theatre. It could be the first time they have touched the world of theatre, or they could live in it daily for years. Either way, the experiences they have with you can turn them off to theatre forever or light a little spark that results in an email years later from that one painter who says, �Hey, Mrs. So-And-So, I just wanted to let you know that I switched my major to theatre. I know I wasn’t ever really involved in productions. Still, I enjoyed your class and thought this would be cool to pursue.” All this to say, sure; there are team-building exercises and bonding strategies to make your crew feel included or like a team, but any teacher who has sat through �team building” as a faculty knows that it is ineffective when compared to the 1-minute daily check in that your coworker has with you on the way in from the parking lot. Just extend the same check-ins you have with your actors to your technicians.THE SCENE: Theatre tech can be pretty demanding. How do you motivate your crew to maintain their enthusiasm and commitment throughout production?ANTHONY: This is a tough one, for sure. Fortunately, in the world of theatre education, productions are very limited runs. We don’t have to replicate a show eight times a week for months on end. I think the key for me is variety and improvement. There is no �Alright, that’s a wrap. Nice job, everybody, let’s do it again tomorrow!” No, we look at what happened with that rehearsal, that performance, that test run of an effect, and then we analyze the good and the bad. If something didn’t work, sweet! How do we improve that for next time? That’s easy engagement because you’re still problem-solving. In my opinion, when things are running smoothly, the enthusiasm begins to fade. But we’re not a Broadway production. There are only two more nights of performances. Challenge your technicians and designers to change things. Of course, please don’t leave it open-ended like that because that will surely be disastrous. But, in the same way, you encourage your actors to keep diving deeper into their character, encouraging your technicians to see what tweaks they could make to their jobs to improve the show overall. And let’s be honest, how many of these shows we put on are 100% the way we want them on opening night anyway?THE SCENE: Could you walk us through identifying and recruiting potential technicians or designers? What qualities do you look for?ANTHONY: This depends on whether I’m recruiting from the student body or within my classes or program. If it’s within your classes, this is quickly done by getting to know your students a little better. Ask them questions about what they like and their interests outside of classes. Dig into why they like what they like, listening for buzzwords that could tie into an area of technical theatre. I have found very few students for whom I couldn’t find some niche of technical theatre that they could enjoy. It’s a match-making game between a student and many jobs in technical theatre. For particularly tricky students, the more specific or esoteric, the better. I had a student who liked painting lines. She was moderately involved in other things as needed, but she was committed when we needed some lines painted. And that’s how you want to start. Find something they’ll wholeheartedly commit to, no matter how insignificant. They’ll take ownership of that, and before you know it, she's the paint charge of every show her senior year. Regarding recruiting students from the greater student body, I find that most students have no idea what we do in the theatre department besides reciting Shakespeare, so a little advertising goes a long way. Bring the drills if there is some �Elective Day” or �Club Day” where you can set up a table. Bring a miter saw if you can. Set up a ladder with a stage light hanging from it. Take the soundboard! I had so many students from the school who didn’t realize that audio mixing was something that we do in theatre. Advertise the variety of pathways in your technical theatre department as much as you advertise your shows.THE SCENE: How do you encourage open, effective communication among crew members, ensuring seamless production?ANTHONY: That’s a quick one. Meetings. You cannot expect all the actors in a finale to perform seamlessly if they have only ever attended separate rehearsals for �leads,” �featured dancers,” and �ensemble.” Similarly, meetings tie together the often disparate areas of technical theatre. Have them as frequently as you deem necessary. The more, the better, even if it is just a brief check-in where many areas may have no advancements to report.THE SCENE: As technology evolves, so does the world of theatre tech. How do you keep students up to date with the latest advancements and trends in Stagecraft?ANTHONY: This is more of a philosophy for everything in life, but you should always question how and why you are doing what you are doing. This is the philosophy that I approach Stagecraft with. I think it’s a very daunting task to constantly be on top of trends or advancements in technology from year to year, but if you haven’t made a star-drop background in a few years, do a few minutes of research. Have they invented some new cheap Christmas lights that produce an excellent star effect? Maybe you see an explanation on TikTok for an illusion that would be incredible to replicate on a cyc. Just last week, I saw a new tool that can cut cardboard incredibly fast with nearly zero risk of slicing yourself open with a utility knife. Whenever I approach a project, no matter how often I’ve done something similar, I try to devote at least a few short minutes to Googling or phoning a friend. You’ll be amazed at how many things former theatre teachers have taught us that make absolutely no sense.THE SCENE: Collaboration between the tech crew and cast is vital. How do you facilitate a harmonious working relationship between these essential production components?ANTHONY: In my opinion, and perhaps it’s a hot take, the dynamic between cast and crew depends entirely on the energy and respect a teacher/director brings to their program/production. They are all working toward the same goal with different jobs. It helps to have leaders in the department who can slide between technician and acting roles depending on the show or even the point in the process. One of my leading musical actresses was also one of our best stage managers, and I’ve had designers who decided to dip their toes in ensemble work while still holding a full designer title. I think the biggest problems I’ve encountered had to do with the authority that Stage Managers have over actors and everyone else. In those situations, you must maintain the authority of that Stage Manager in front of the cast and crew while also taking that Stage Manager aside to gently knock them down several pegs.THE SCENE: The 2023-24 school year holds its unique challenges. How has the evolving landscape of education and theatre influenced your approach to building a resilient backstage crew?ANTHONY: While I have always preached this, I think now, more than ever, it is crucial to focus on the skills and day-to-day experience rather than the product. The product is a production. Give your technicians projects that are independent of shows. It is fantastic for your friends and family to see curtains open to reveal a set you designed and built. Still, I have seen students infinitely more excited to parade a perfectly sculpted and painted prop potato through the halls. Productions are lovely, but we must give our students other things to build up their skills and confidence throughout the year. If the entire year's success hinges on that spring musical, there is a long road to recovery for your students and your department when that spring musical can’t continue as initially planned.THE SCENE: Looking ahead to the future of 'Simple Stagecraft,' what exciting projects or initiatives do you have in mind to empower theatre tech enthusiasts further worldwide?ANTHONY: Oh, there is quite a bit on the horizon. After having my second baby, I had to take a hefty hiatus, but now we’re coming out swinging. I started to get a lot of traction last year with my Technical Theatre Bell Ringers on TikTok, from teachers to industry professionals to former theatre kids who just wanted that dose of nostalgia. That’s going to be my priority for now, a bell ringer every weekday, and then I hope to expand into more tips, tricks, and thoughts for technical theatre through the same medium. In the not-too-distant future, I want to ramp up the production of more instructional YouTube videos again. Still, unfortunately, that has to wait until I can justify the time commitment. Beyond that, I hope to publish some written content within the next year with specific guides and techniques for engaging your student technicians and designers and bolstering your technical theatre capabilities. Some of those should find their way into workshops I plan to tour across some theatre conferences, specifically a workshop with the working title �Dungeons and Designers: Inspire Theatrical Design Through Roleplay.” Suppose you want to follow along with any of those initiatives and support the movement for technical theatre education. In that case, you can find me on TikTok and YouTube at SimpleStagecraft or both. I also recently launched a Patreon, which I hope will buy me the time to dip out of the day job more and more to create content across all these excellent mediums. THE SCENE: Anthony, Thank you for speaking with us today. I do not doubt that this information will be helpful for theatre educators everywhere.-- For more information on Simple Stagecraft and Anthony Arena, check out the Simple Stagecraft YouTube channel at https://youtube.com/SimpleStagecraft or visit the Simple Stagecraft TikTok page available at this link: https://www.tiktok.com/@simplestagecraft.

Fire Exit opens in the aftermath, as the community faces what appears to be a prank gone terribly wrong. But as the kids and adults open up about their lives and the bigger picture of the day's events emerges, the truth proves to be far less simple. Told through a series of poignant and often very funny monologues, Fire Exit is a powerful ensemble piece that proves things, and people, aren't always as they seem.Drama | 30 - 35 minutes | 3 W, 2 M, 3 Any (4-8 actors possible: 2-6 W, 2-5 M) | Set: MinimalI Don't Want to Talk About Itby Bradley HaywardTHE STORY: Being a teenager is hard, and nobody wants to talk about it. Confronting the daily challenges of growing up, this series of monologues and scenes offers a look at a multitude of issues -- including dealing with parents who just don't get it, rumors, bullying, and suicide. By turns funny and tragic, the gritty details of adolescence surface -- exposing the things teenagers can't, won't, and don't want to talk about.Dramedy | 30 - 45 minutes | 5 Any (5-32 actors possible: 0-32 W, 0-32 M) | Set: None.ShareIf you liked this post from The Scene, why not share it?

George Harold, one of the playwrights, arrives in a drunken fury with a cynical script revision. Shortly after, Marjorie Bright, George's spouse and co-playwright, introduces her own alternate ending. The actors are now caught in an impossible dilemma, piecing together a coherent script from the fragments of the playwrights' collapsing marriage.The Gift Listby Kyle Nesbit Santa isn’t the only one who has to check his Christmas list twice. After siblings Keith and Caroline ask for an unwieldy seventy-nine presents from Saint Nick, two elves arrive to tell the kids they can’t have everything they want. Luckily, Keith and Caroline—and their parents—are prepared to negotiate. Funny and charming, THE GIFT LIST is a one-act play about dreaming big and making holiday wishes come true.Return of the Scriptby Don Zolidis Miss Walters’s life is upended after she does the unthinkable and forgets to return a perusal script. Now, she’s on the run from international conglomerate Musical Theater Global, trying to dodge the two agents they sent after her. (Which is especially hard since one of them can talk to birds.) If Miss Walters wants to live one day more, she must find and return the perusal before MTG finds her. Where the Sky Meets the Seaby Mandy Conner Five Greek children find themselves abandoned on an island until an oracle sends then on a mystical quest to seek their release--at the cost of a sacrifice.Lord of the Choirby Don Zolidis A choir, a limited supply of marshmallows, and a broken-down bus: What’s the worst that could happen? Definitely not anything that could’ve happened in Lord of the Flies. Between prideful sopranos and wannabe basses, who will come out on top? Or will no chorister be left standing?The Conby Tracy Wells Set at a Comic Con, this play consists of a series of vignettes, each with their own stand-alone story that also furthers the under-lying plot of a con in progress. There’s a bat-tastic hero clowning around with his foe in �The LARP Knight Rises,” a video game menace who loses it in more ways than one in �A Plumber Cracks,” a D&D newbie who wants to let her inner gnome shine in �The Ballad of Lena Moonfallen,” some costumed competitors who will stop at nothing to complete their quartet in �Cosplaying with Fire,” and much more.

"Meta's New AI Tool is Here: Dissecting Code LlamaToday let's look at Code Llama, compare it to other dev-focused AI tools on the market, and talk tips for getting the most out of them. AI remains at the forefront of tech news with the ever-expanding roster of AI coding assistants. Meta recently launched its own assistant called Code Llama. I haven't had a chance to play around with it much, but I'm eager to see how it handles natural language prompts. (They also created a variant specifically optimized for Python). This is particularly exciting news for those interested in learning how to code — it's never been easier to get started on your own projects. Today I want to take a look at Code Llama and compare it to other dev-focused AI tools on the market and share some tips on how to get the most out of them. Though built with a similar purpose, each of these models have a certain degree of variability in pricing, out-of-the-box functionality, and public access. I've also included a cheat sheet for breaking down some new and popular AI assistant models at a glance. Who knows — maybe you’ll find yourself a new coding assistant. If you’re interested in learning how to use AI tools more effectively, or would like a deeper understanding of the intricacies behind code assistants like Code Llama, check out our new course: All You Need to Know About Prompt Engineering. By the end, you'll have a foundational knowledge of generative AI and prompt engineering, and you'll be able to craft prompts that elicit accurate and nuanced responses from a range of tools. (Note: Educative offers its own AI-assisted learning feature! It's currently available in our Grokking Coding Interview Patterns courses. If you haven't had a chance to check it out yet, give it a shot and let me know what you think.) Without further ado, let's get the rundown on Code Llama.Free engineering leadership ebookWhat's the state of your developer onboarding? � Tips on enabling developer tools.� Setting clear communication expectations.� Building effective productivity metric frameworks.Download NowCode LlamaDeveloped by MetaFree3 models: general, Python, and natural languageAvailable for research and commercial useOpen-sourceThis large language model (LLM) accepts both natural language and code in prompts and can return a mix of both as output. Built on top of Llama 2, Meta’s general model, Code Llama consists of three different offerings:Code Llama (the foundational code model)Code Llama - Python (specialized for Python programming)Code Llama - Instruct (fine-tuned for understanding natural language instructions).Each model varies in parameters– a metric used to determine how AI tools process data and generate predictions. The base, instruct, and Python models have 7B, 13B, and 34B parameters, respectively. As a general rule of thumb, more parameters mean that a model is more sophisticated. Meta’s Code Llama paper sheds light on Code Llama's development, limitations, and guidelines for responsible use. They note that Code Llama's performance demonstrated superior results compared to other open-source code-specific LLMs: �On multilingual benchmarks, even our smallest model (Code Llama 7B) outperforms every other public model.” Code Llama's models feature a high degree of context, allowing for more relevant code generation. This is most apparent when debugging large codebases. As of this writing, Code Llama is free for research and commercial use and consists of an open source code. Meta states: �​We follow the approach of learning from publicly available code only, without additional meta-level or temporal information such as issues or commits.”GPT4Developed by OpenAI$20 per month1.7T parametersAvailable to the publicClosed-sourceChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, remains the gold standard for AI chat bots— producing helpful results more accurately and frequently than any other of its kind. As for coding, that gold standard relies more heavily on use case, community adoption, and individual preferences. Similar to Code Llama, the new GPT4 model can understand both code and natural language — making the platform more accessible for those learning to code. Access requires a subscription to GPT Plus, which costs $20 per month. GPT4 is not open-source; users will not have access to its code, model architecture, or data. This makes it especially challenging to reliably reproduce results.Github CopilotDeveloped by Github$10 per month12B parametersClosed-sourceHalf the monthly price of GPT4, GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that offers suggestions on the go. A GitHub personal account is required in order to gain access. Advertised as an assistant that aids the speed of writing, Github Copilot makes autocomplete suggestions while writing code. It's designed to improve developer productivity, reduce coding errors, and help with code exploration and learning. Github Copilot does come with some potential drawbacks in reliability, code quality, privacy, and licensing concerns. Its effectiveness may also depend on the specific use case and the developer's skill level. Some users claim the AI assistant provides too many suggestions at once, which some may find distracting. Github’s rumored enhancement to Copilot, Copilot X, remains vaporware. This LLM is planned to achieve context aware conversation and more personalized answers. There’s currently a waitlist for full access, but a technical preview is available on Github’s website. Amazon CodeWhispererDeveloped by AmazonFreeSize unknownAvailable for public useClosed-sourceAmazon's AI assistant, CodeWhisperer, functions much like GitHub Copilot, generating personalized code suggestions in real-time. What sets it apart is its strong focus on security; it excels in identifying and resolving potential security issues in your code, making it a valuable tool for writing secure applications. It's worth noting that, similar to GPT4, CodeWhisperer is available for public use but is not open-source, allowing developers to leverage its capabilities while keeping its core functionality proprietary.Duet AIDeveloped by Google$30 per monthSize unknown Available for pre-order for enterprise customers Duet AI represents Google's venture into the realm of LLMs. While this AI assistant is not yet publicly available, it offers a pre-order option for enterprise customers at a competitive rate of $30 per month. Currently in its preview phase, the Google AI assistant exhibits potential, although it does come with its fair share of limitations. Notably, it currently only accepts English dialect inputs, which may restrict its accessibility for some users. However, similar to several other LLMs, Duet AI excels at processing natural language inputs and comes equipped with a versatile chat assistant, underscoring its promise as a tool for enhancing various aspects of language-related tasks and interactions.Salesforce CodeGenDeveloped by SalesforceFree7B parametersNot publicly availableClosed-source Developed by Salesforce, CodeGen stands out as an intuitive and conversational LLM. What sets it apart from the rest is its compact size. At 7B parameters, CodeGen is the smallest LLM on this list. However, developers who have received early access to the tool have lauded its remarkable performance despite its smaller footprint, emphasizing the small but mighty nature of this AI tool. While it promises to be accessible to a wide audience by eventually offering free access, it's important to note that CodeGen is not yet available to the public, leaving developers anticipating its release and the potential it holds.StarCoder Developed by ServiceNow and Hugging FaceAvailable for lifetime purchase in Lite ($50), Plus($80), or Pro($125)15.5B parametersAvailable to the publicOpen-sourceIntroduced in 2023, StarCoder was developed by ServiceNow and Hugging Face as a large language model specifically for code. Three versions of StarCoder exist: Lite, Plus, and Pro, each tailored to meet varying user needs. With this assistant, users purchase a lifetime plan for either $50, $80, or $125, respectively, providing flexibility in choosing the features and capabilities that suit their requirements best. However, it's important to note that, like many new language models, StarCoder relies heavily on training data and may continue to evolve and improve as it gains more usage and training, making it an exciting tool for developers to watch in the evolving landscape of AI-driven coding assistance. It should be noted that there are many other AI assistants that I wasn’t able to break down here, with new models continuously being introduced. I will be curious to see what new tools are developed in the near future, as well as how currently popular models like ChatGPT continue to evolve.Remember... AI assistants enhance (not replace) developer productivity Of course, we're continuing to hear the same anxieties and questions about the future of software development: will tools like Code Llama take developer jobs? The answer remains a resounding no, and here’s why. When discussing these AI assistants, it’s important to hold an emphasis on the word �assistant.” As powerful as they are, they remain to be an amped-up version of autocomplete. As programmers, in order to solve a problem, we must decide what tools to leverage, and then translate the solution into a programming language that a compiler can interpret. These new tools can’t solve the problem for us. But where they do excel is at reducing tedium. The grunt work of producing the boilerplate code is now extended to full functions and relatively big programs. Where we once had to go line-by-line, these tools can help us quickly scale to tens or even hundreds of lines. While it is remarkable to see computer programs generate fully functional code, ultimately these tools are simply time savers, and they're great when it comes to writing simple, straightforward code. However, you still have to manually tweak it and optimize performance. These small nuances won’t go away anytime soon, but writing that draft version is becoming more and more convenient. The truth is that all of these models combined won’t replace any coders. They will help with the productivity of existing programmers. Moreover, as these AI assistants become more prevalent in the software development landscape, developers should seize the opportunity to upskill and adapt. Learning how to effectively harness the power of AI assistants can not only make your work more efficient, but can also free up time and mental energy to focus on the creative and problem-solving aspects of coding. It's essential to view these tools as collaborators, working alongside you to amplify your capabilities rather than as potential job replacements. As AI assistants proliferate and reshape the software development landscape, the anxiety about their potential impact on software development as a career is best alleviated through embracing these tools as allies in a constantly evolving field. Even if you don’t plan on becoming an AI engineer, having the tool of prompt engineering in your toolbelt is essential regardless of your position. With our new course All You Need to Know About Prompt Engineering, you’ll not only optimize AI tools' performance but also ensure that they provide valuable insights and solutions tailored to your needs.

"�� Design Uber the right way (video tutorial breakdown)Enjoy this step-by-step breakdown of 3 real-world System Design Interview questions: Design Uber, Design Spotify, Design Twitter. Recently I worked with Educative’s technical content team on a video covering the Basics of System Design. That tutorial unpacks the building blocks of modern System Design, i.e. core fundamentals of distributed systems that every engineer should know.Today, I'd like to share a sequel to that video: a step-by-step breakdown of 3 real-world System Design Interview questions.Check out the full tutorial on YouTube!Watch on YouTubeThis video tutorial puts the fundamentals into practice via three of my favorite System Design questions that I love to ask in interviews:Design UberDesign SpotifyDesign X (Formerly Twitter)I talk about the core value proposition for each system – i.e. the element that makes each of these systems unique – and then give you a repeatable blueprint for approaching any System Design question.What's so special about these 3 questions? Most System Design questions will start the same way. Once you receive the question (e.g. �design a rideshare service”), you will be expected to ask clarifying questions and sketch out a high level design on the whiteboard. At this phase, I want candidates to do the following:Demonstrate that they know how to scope the problem appropriatelyIdentify the most critical design challengesZero in on the most important trade-offsBut there is a secret to a truly great System Design Interview. In addition to demonstrating a working knowledge of distributed systems and System Design building blocks, you need to demonstrate an understanding of the qualities that make the system in question unique. I go deeper on this point in the video using three real-world examples, but here’s the truth: Missing the right spot to dive deep and demonstrate specialized knowledge is one of the most common SDI blunders I see. That’s why the key to successful SDI prep is to study up on the core value propositions of the main systems you’ll be asked to build.I selected these three questions because they provide a fairly comprehensive representation of the kinds of questions you might encounter in a System Design Interview. Mastering these three questions will give you a huge advantage in your actual interview, because they cover a wide swath of System Design problems you might encounter.Need more System Design Interview practice? Of course this video tutorial is hardly comprehensive. If you are looking to get more hands-on practice with System Design Interview questions, I recommend our popular course: Grokking the Modern System Design Interview for Engineers & Managers. In addition to covering the fundamental building blocks of modern System Design, this hands-on course breaks down 13 common real-world System Design problems. Each problem starts with a brief discussion of the system and its main value proposition. Then it highlights the necessary key components that lead to the solution that your interviewer is looking for. Given the breadth and variety of System Design Interviews, they can often make or break the interview loop for many engineers. I hope this tutorial gets you more confident with the System Design Interview process. All it takes is a little practice. Good luck with your interviews, and happy learning!

"Top 7 FAQs from beginner programmersHere are the most common questions from new & aspiring programmers. You'll see that learning to code is easier than you might think. Today I want to round up a few of the most common questions I hear from new and aspiring programmers. I hope to address your concerns, provide a few tips, and show why learning to code is more attainable than you might think — as long as you approach it the right way. One last thing before I dive in: If you are ready to take the next step in your programming journey (or know someone who wants to learn), I highly recommend our Learn to Code courses here at Educative. They are perfect for beginners and are available with a free trial. It’s how I would do it if I had to learn how to code all over again. Now let’s get started!1) What is the best way to learn how to code? Someone once told me that learning how to code is similar to learning how to drive. Imagine wanting to speed onto the highway the first time you sit behind the wheel. Sounds premature, doesn't it? When learning how to drive, most people start in the parking lot. You need to figure out the gas and brakes, how to maneuver the gear shift, get a feel for the turning radius. Only after you have built this muscle memory is it safe to merge onto busy roads. I see their point. I have found that the best way to learn how to code follows a similar blueprint. At Educative, our goal is to help people learn programming skills as efficiently as possible. That starts with learning and internalizing the fundamentals in a hands-on way. These fundamentals will serve you for the rest of your career. Then you can progress to real-world projects, putting into practice the muscle memory you have been developing. And most importantly, this sturdy foundation will enable you to quickly learn new skills in the future.2) When should I start focusing on projects? Once you have a solid command of the basics, you will want to start applying them in real-world applications. You can think of little �toy problems” as your driving lessons in the parking lot. These are good exercises for helping build that fundamental muscle memory we just discussed. However, there comes a point when staying in the parking lot is counterproductive. To become a confident and effective driver, you have to get out into the streets. In coding terms, this means starting to take on actual projects. Professional developers typically work on small components of a massive project in their day-to-day. This is vastly different from solving a one-off toy problem in 10 minutes. A project-based approach to learning simulates your eventual experience on the job. But a word of caution: don’t throw yourself into the deep end until after you have really built the muscle memory and internalized the fundamentals. It takes effort and discipline, but with a little support and structure, you’ll reach your destination. P.S. Here at Educative, we offer structured learning paths specially for beginners. These skill paths provide a guided, step-by-step approach to proficiency in a variety of programming languages and career specializations — from the basics to real-world projects and beyond. You can view all of our beginner skill paths here.3) What programming language should I learn first? I get asked this question all the time. But here’s the truth: the first programming language you learn isn’t nearly as important as many people think it is. Here’s why. A programming language is just a vehicle for translating your solution into a format that a computer can understand. Some languages are better for different use cases than others, but they all serve the same fundamental purpose. That’s why if you invest the time to properly learn your computer science fundamentals, it will enable you to learn any programming language in the future. In this sense, it doesn’t matter that much which language you learn first. The most important thing you can do when just starting out is to establish the right foundation. In other words, the specifics of the language are negotiable; the fundamentals aren’t. Of course you still have to start somewhere. So I think the better question is: �which programming language is the right one for me?” Some people say that Python is relatively easy to learn, while also being extremely versatile and powerful (think backend development, machine learning, and data science). HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also good options for beginners, and make a lot of sense for anyone who may be interested in web development. Recently I have been keen on several newer languages (relatively speaking) like Go and Ruby. Kotlin may be a good choice if you’re especially interested in mobile development. I personally learned to code using C++ and am still a huge fan of its power and performance — but if I were just starting today, I would at least consider Rust as an alternative. Anyway, this breakdown on our blog covers a handful of essential programming languages, and why they may (or may not) be a good fit for you. P.S. I’d also recommend checking out StackOverflow’s annual developer survey. It’s a great place to look if you are curious about the most popular (or unpopular) and most in-demand languages and specializations!4) What's the hardest part about learning how to code? There’s no way around it: learning how to code isn’t easy. It can be very tedious and frustrating at times. However, the most surprising place where I see a lot of new learners struggle isn’t at the beginning — it’s in the last mile. The first step is all about learning the fundamentals: problem-solving skills, logic and reasoning, foundational computer science concepts. The second step is when you start applying those fundamentals to solve real-world problems. This part is about deploying your logic and reasoning to come up with a solution to a problem, and then translating that solution into a programming language so it can be understood by a computer. But there’s one final step that people often miss: interview prep. You can get a foot in the door and land an interview with a good portfolio of projects. But your success in tech interviews requires an entirely new toolbox. A lot of people don’t realize that interviewing is a skill that can be developed and practiced just like any other technical skill (I say this as someone who has interviewed hundreds of engineering candidates throughout my career). The industry is definitely competitive. But with the right preparation and approach, any qualified candidate can be successful. Just remember — the learning doesn’t stop once you’ve mastered the basics!5) Do I need a Computer Science degree to get a job? The short answer: no. The slightly longer answer: no, but you do need to master computer science fundamentals in order to be successful in the long run. There are many incredible courses and resources available online these days. With some structure and focus, you can simulate a formal computer science education using tools available to you on the internet. I personally have a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science, and I believe it has served me well in my career. But having been in the industry for a long time, and having worked with a variety of talented developers from many different backgrounds, I truly believe that you can be successful without a formal CS education. Which brings us to another related question I get a lot: will self-taught programmers be at a disadvantage? First of all, I would actually argue that all programmers are �self-taught.” I identify as a lifelong learner, and I think most other developers would, too. In order to stay current on new technologies and stay competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape, there is no choice but to keep learning. That pursuit is what led me to create Educative — to help developers like myself efficiently learn the skills they need to continually level up in their career.However, there is one caveat that I should note: you will likely have to work a bit harder to get in the door. You will have to be intentional about getting real-world experience through projects and open source contributions (GitHub is a great place for this). But with the right tools and hard work, you can absolutely build the resume, portfolio, and skill set you need to break into the industry.6) How long will it take me to learn how to code? This depends on a number of factors — most notably the amount of time and effort you are able to invest. There is no substitute for putting in the work. (I have also found that consistent, daily practice is more effective than occasional bursts of learning). But here are a couple other factors that typically affect the time it takes new programmers to learn. Your Purpose & GoalsDo you aim to become a professional software developer? Or are you just wanting to learn some basic coding skills for a hobby or a specific small project? The depth of knowledge you’ll need varies significantly between these scenarios. There's also a big difference between understanding the basics and syntax of a language and mastering more advanced concepts like data structures, algorithms, and System Design. (For the latter, I can attest that it is a lifelong pursuit!) Background & InterestsPeople with a background in logic-heavy fields, such as mathematics, physics, or engineering, might find certain coding concepts more intuitive. On the other hand, those without such a background might need more time to grasp foundational concepts. That said, you don’t need to be a math whiz or have a STEM degree in order to learn how to code. All it takes is the right approach and a little work ethic. Given these factors, here are some rough time estimates:Learn the basics of a programming language (e.g., Python or JavaScript): A few weeks to a few monthsBecome proficient enough to build simple projects: Several months to a yearBecome job-ready for a junior developer position: Anywhere from 6 months with an intensive bootcamp to 4 years with a traditional university degree (I like to think that Educative offers a more accessible sweet spot between these two extremes)Attain a level of mastery or specialization: Many years of practice, continuous learning, and real-world experience (take it from me — the journey never really ends!)Ultimately, your Learn to Code journey is entirely your own. While some people might find certain concepts straightforward, others might have a harder time with them. The key is persistence, consistent practice, and a desire to keep learning and growing. If you are a curious and growth-minded person, learning how to code can be a wonderful challenge and opportunity.7) How is Educative different from other learning platforms? Here is one last analogy for today: I have always thought that learning how to code is a lot like learning how to swim. You can’t really learn to swim or code just by watching someone else do it. This is a big reason why we don’t use videos on Educative. Instead, we place a heavy focus on coding sandboxes, playgrounds, and interactive quizzes where you can practice your skills in real-time. (You also don’t need to download any software or configure your machine — you can learn and code right there in your browser window). Now here’s the rub: many platforms might give you the sense of swimming by handing you flotation devices. But that doesn’t mean you’re actually learning how to swim. Here’s what I mean. It is a popular approach to get learners building projects right away. They do this with a formulaic, step-by-step process where you are given a list of commands that you are expected to implement, without much context into what you’re doing or why you’re doing it. I believe this approach is so popular because it gives learners the instant gratification of having built something. Now I’m not saying that some gratification isn’t important (learning can never be so theoretical that you can’t see the real-world application). But what happens when the flotation devices are pulled away and you have to create something from scratch all by yourself? Any CS professor will tell you that this �paint-by-numbers” approach is not a formula for success, nor is it a pathway to long-term retention of information. At Educative, we start in the shallow end, making sure you internalize the fundamental logic, math, and problem solving skills. Remember: if your app is built for 3 people or 3 billion people, the underlying logic remains the same. So if you are still wondering if coding is for you, I say take the plunge. Just make sure you’re in the right pool. For that, I hope you give Educative a try. What questions do you still have about learning how to code? Please let me know. I hope we can help you feel as comfortable and confident as possible on your learning journey. Happy learning!

"5 quick & dirty System Design Interview tips (+ WhatsApp case study)Try these 5 quick & dirty System Design tips to avoid common interview mistakes. Then practice your skills with Design WhatsApp. Back when I regularly interviewed software engineering candidates, I found that even the most talented developers often struggled with System Design questions. Even more surprising? These candidates ran into the exact same set of mistakes. System Design Interviews are tricky for many developers because they are intentionally open-ended. Unlike in coding interviews, in System Design there is rarely a correct or perfect answer. Your success in this loop depends less on your technical skills, and more on your capacity to reason, communicate, make tradeoffs, and defend your decision-making. Today, I want to share 5 quick and dirty tips for tackling any System Design Interview question (while avoiding common traps). Then we'll walk through one real-world case study: Design a Messaging Service (e.g. WhatsApp). Let's dive in!Register For FreeFINAL CALL: Free Exclusive Webinar Last chance to save your spot for our upcoming webinar with Stefano Magni. Stefano is a front-end expert who will share practical insights from over 10+ years maintaining large codebases. We'll discuss: Maintaining Large Codebases While GrowingBest Practices for React, Dependencies, and TypeScriptCode Reviews and Dealing with Technical DebtAdditional Resources and Live Q&A!

When you register, you will be entered into a drawing for a free Educative Unlimited subscription5 tips to solve any System Design question Let's start with a few best practices to help you structure your answer. This will also help you avoid mistakes that trip up even the most skilled devs. 1) State your assumptionsStart by listing all required features of the system, common problems you expect to encounter with this sort of system, and the traffic you expect the system to handle. The listing process lets the interviewer see your planning skills and correct any possible misunderstandings before you begin the solution. 2) Ask your interviewer follow-up questionsMost System Design questions are purposefully vague. Ask clarifying questions to hone in on the requirements and demonstrate your knowledge of the system’s needs. 3) Narrate trade-offsEvery design choice matters. There is never a perfect solution that optimizes for every requirement. At each decision point, list at least one positive and one negative effect of that choice. 4) Discuss emerging technologiesConclude each question with an overview of how and where the system could benefit from machine learning, or other emerging tech. This will demonstrate that you’re not just prepared for current solutions but future contingencies as well. 5) Study your architecturesMost modern services are built upon a flexible microservice architecture. Unlike the monolithic architectures of tech companies in the past, microservices allow smaller, agile teams to build independently from the larger system. Some older companies will have legacy systems. However, microservices can function in parallel to legacy code and help refresh the company architecture as a whole.Case Study: Design a Messaging Service (e.g. WhatsApp) Let's put these tips to the test in a real-world case study. Variations of this question are very popular across the industry. The specific wording may vary (e.g. Design WhatsApp or Design Facebook Messenger), but the objective is the same — you will have to design a messaging service, which will have a unique set of characteristics and requirements. Essentially, you will design a service that allows users to chat with each other over the internet. Conversations can be one-on-one or can be group chats with many members. Messages should only be accessible by those included in the conversation. A good place to start with any System Design Interview question is to review functional and non-functional requirements. (NOTE: You can find a much more detailed, step-by-step breakdown of Design WhatsApp in our popular course: Grokking Modern System Design Interview for Engineers & Managers). Requirements Functional requirementsOnline: Messages must be sent and received via the internetMulti-functional: Service must support one-on-one and group chatsArchived: Messages should be stored for later viewingFile agnostic: Users should be able to send pictures and videos as well as text messagesProtected: Messages should be encrypted during transitNon-functional requirementsConsistency: Above all else, the system should be consistent; users should see the same chat log on all devices.Availability: High availability is desirable, but not as crucial as consistency.Low latency: The system should be extremely low latency, offering a real-time chatting experience.High-level Design The high-level design for a messenger application is fairly simple. A user contacts a chat server and sends a message. The chat server relays the message to the user it was intended for, and then stores the message in a database. Once the message is delivered, the server notifies the sender that the message was successfully transmitted.The following steps describe the communication between both clients:User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.User A sends a message to the chat server.Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message. WhatsApp APIsWhatsApp in particular offers a large quantity of features via APIs. It is a good idea to brush up on essential APIs calls, including:Send messageGet messageUpload a media file or documentDownload a media file or documentSend locationSend contactCreate a status(For a detailed breakdown of WhatsApp's high-level and API design, check out our course: Grokking Modern System Design Interview for Engineers & Managers) Key TradeoffsIn every System Design problem, there are important trade-offs that you will have to make and justify to your interviewer. There are two particular tradeoffs you will want to account for in this particular design: 1) Consistency vs. AvailabilityAccording to CAP theorem, a system can either ensure consistency or availability during network disruptions. For an application like WhatsApp, where the sequence of messages is vital, consistency must take precedence over availability. 2) Latency vs. SecurityWhile users value a real-time experience through low latency, security remains paramount, especially for platforms like WhatsApp. The dilemma arises when attempting to securely transmit messages, especially multimedia. Encrypting such data can introduce significant delays (as depicted in the illustration below), necessitating an intentional balance between quick responses and robust security measures. Detailed Design Questions to Prepare ForWhat happens if a message is sent without an internet connection? Is it sent when the connection is restored?How will you encrypt and decrypt the message without increasing latency?How do users receive notifications?Are messages pulled from the device (server periodically prompts the devices if they’re waiting to send a message) or are pushed to the server (device prompts the server that it has a message to send)? Tools & Strategies to ConsiderSplit the database schema into multiple tables: user table (with the user ID and contacts), a chat table (with chat IDs and a list of participating user IDs), and message table (with past messages a reference to the chat ID).Use WebSocket for bi-directional connections between device and server.Use Push notifications to notify members even if they’re offline.Grokking Modern System Design Interviews I hope this quick case study was helpful! For a much more in-depth breakdown of Design WhatsApp, along with 12 other popular design questions (including Design Uber, YouTube, and Facebook Newsfeed), I highly recommend our best-selling course: Grokking Modern System Design Interview for Engineers & Managers. You'll learn System Design fundamentals that will set you up for success in your interviews and beyond. Give it a try and let me know what you think. Happy learning!

As you prepare yourself and your students for the next auditions, The Scene is here to help by offering some guidance on conducting successful auditions for your next high school production. Let's start this journey together and help ensure a prosperous and inclusive experience for all.Step 1: Set the StageCreating an environment that fosters trust and encouragement is crucial. From the initial casting announcement to the audition day, communicate your expectations clearly and often. Provide ample information on the play or musical, the roles available, character descriptions, the audition process, selection criteria, and any required materials for preparation. Encourage students of all experience levels to participate, emphasizing that auditions are an opportunity for growth and self-expression.Step 2: The Audition ProcessDuring auditions, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere where students feel comfortable showcasing their talents is essential. Promote a supportive environment by encouraging students to cheer on their peers(if they stay in the room during auditions). Remind them that auditions are not just about individual success but also about creating an ensemble that harmonizes as one. Also, remind them that you, as the director, not only want them to be successful.Step 3: Communicating with ParentsParents play a vital role in supporting their child's passion for the arts. Establish open lines of communication by hosting a parent meeting early on in the rehearsal process, if not before auditions. Once in rehearsal, send occasional newsletters and emails that outline the audition process and provide details on other topics such as casting, trial, and production schedules, and of course, other activities in which parents can also be involved. Everyone has many extra events and activities, so encourage parents to be involved and offer their support.Step 4: Celebrating Success and Managing DisappointmentAfter auditions, it is essential to communicate the results with sensitivity and care. Celebrate the achievements of those who secured roles and offer constructive feedback to those who did not. Emphasize that casting decisions do not reflect an individual's worth but rather a complex puzzle that strives to create the best possible ensemble for the production. Encourage disappointed students to channel their energy into other production areas, such as stage crew or assisting with set design, fostering a sense of belonging and purpose.Step 5: Nurturing the EnsembleOnce the cast is selected, it is time to embark on the rehearsal journey. Establish clear expectations and a supportive environment where collaboration and creativity can flourish. Please encourage students to connect, fostering a sense of camaraderie that will strengthen their performances on stage.Remember, you teach students about the arts and impart valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and resilience. Each student who walks through your audition doors possesses unique potential waiting to be harnessed. As you embark on this rewarding journey, remember that auditions are just the beginning. The true magic lies in the transformative power of the arts, where students discover their voices, explore their passions, and create memories that will last a lifetime.ShareFREE READSRead entire plays for free!

"Google Account policy updateEvery day, Google works hard to keep you and your private information safe and secure by preventing unauthorised access to your Google Account with our built-in security protections. And keeping you safe means having strong privacy practices across our products that minimise how long we store your personal files and any data associated with them. We want to protect your private information and prevent any unauthorised access to your account even if you’re no longer using our services.Therefore, we are updating the inactivity period for a Google Account to two years across all our products and services. This change starts rolling out today and will apply to any Google Account that’s been inactive, meaning that it has not been signed in to or used within a two-year period. An inactive account and any content in it will be eligible for deletion from 1 December 2023.What this means for you:These changes do not impact you unless you have been inactive in your Google Account for two years or have not used your account to sign in to any Google service for over two years.While the changes go into effect today, the earliest that we would enforce any account deletion would be December 2023.If your account is considered inactive, we will send several reminder emails to both you and your recovery emails (if any have been provided) before we take any action or delete any account content. These reminder emails will go out at least eight months before any action is taken on your account.After a Google Account is deleted, the Gmail address for the deleted account cannot be used again when creating a new Google Account.How to keep your account active?The simplest way to keep a Google Account active is to sign in to the account at least once every two years. If you have signed in to your Google Account recently in the last two years, your account is considered active and will not be deleted.Other ways to keep your account active include:Reading or sending an emailUsing Google DriveWatching a YouTube videoSharing a photoDownloading an appUsing Google SearchUse Sign in with Google to sign in to a third-party app or serviceThere are some exceptions to this policy. Examples include: A Google Account with YouTube channels, videos or comments; an account that has a gift card with a monetary balance; or an account that has a published application, for example, one that hosts an app on the Google Play Store. Other exceptions to this policy are available here.Google also offers tools to help manage your Google Account and provide options to back up your data, including the ability to download your data using Google Takeout, and allowing you to plan for what happens to your data if you’re inactive for a specific period of time with the Inactive Account Manager.Our priority is to make it as easy as possible for you to keep your account active, if you want to, and we’ll ensure that you have adequate notice before any account is impacted by this change. So before an account is deleted, Google will send email notifications to the Google Account and its recovery email (if one has been provided).

"4 ways generative AI is changing the InternetRecently we've seen tech leaders make seemingly strange decisions. Why? The struggle between generative AI and content-rich platforms. Unleashing GenAI:4 Internet Shifts AheadOver the past few months we've seen tech company leaders make seemingly strange decisions. X (or formerly, Twitter) imposed strict rate limits that impacted user experience. Reddit announced a pricing model for its API with costs too steep for many long-time users, leading to protests and ultimately shutting down many third-party apps. These changes upset users in different ways — but they're directly linked to one another. Both represent symptoms of a larger movement that is changing the landscape of the internet: the struggle between generative AI and content-rich platforms. Let's discuss why these changes are happening and what it means for the future of software development.All You Need to Know About Prompt EngineeringStay on the cutting edge of generative AI with this brand new, hands-on course. You’ll look at an overview of prompts and their types, best practices, and role prompting — and learn how to apply those skills in real-world applications.Preview CourseWhat is X's gameplan? Companies like X, Reddit, Quora, LinkedIn, StackOverflow and many others are content-rich platforms. An increasing number of bots are being built to scrape, index, and read these platforms. It's not that companies like X and Reddit can't handle the extra traffic that these bots pose. Instead, these companies actively want to prevent bots from scraping data to feed AI models. In fact, in X/Twitter's rate limiting product update, that reason is first on their list: At a high level, we are working to prevent … [bots and other bad actors] … from 1) scraping people’s public Twitter data to build AI models and 2) manipulating people and conversation on the platform in various ways. X and other content platforms' motivation to gate content from AI is not based on ethics — it's a business decision. These platforms sit on a massive library of human conversations that, up until now, has not been economically valuable. But with the rising tide of AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), this data is in incredibly high demand. Generative AI models are only as good as the content they've consumed. The more exposure AI has to varied or nuanced human information, the better the model will be. In a business-oriented world, why should content companies offer this data for free? Whether through subscriptions, logins, or rate limiting, each platform is now implementing different ways to restrict access to their content. As they lock down content, they essentially become a new breed of content farms, offering quality content at a cost for AI models. When data is blocked and generative AI won’t have unchecked access, models will start performing poorly. AI models will have to pay to access locked-down content platforms because, in the end, generative AI models will only be as good as the content they can afford to consume.4 ways the generative AI landslide may reshape the Internet The rise of generative AI can lead to many repercussions that affect how we've come to navigate the internet. Here I will highlight four areas that will likely change as a result of generative AI. 1) Search ExperiencesIn the past, knowing how to make search engine queries was a real skill. With the prevalence of natural language processing technology however, it may be easier than ever for AI or search engines to understand human queries— especially if ML engineers achieve the lofty goals set forth for generative AI. That said, our search experiences may be impacted in ways we don't yet know. Earlier this year, Google (and to a lesser extent Bing) announced plans to add AI to the Search experience, striking fear into content platforms. Websites have welcomed Google to index their webpages because Google sent them organic traffic in return. However, if Google is able to replace the traditional search engine model with generative AI, there will be no incentive for Google to distribute organic traffic to the highest ranking web pages. Without organic traffic, content platforms and other websites will wither on the vine — and there's no telling yet what the search experience would look like for us. 2) Public Access to Content PlatformsIt's likely that we will continue to see more websites shutter their open access. Sites like X and Reddit will require users to login before they can access content. APIs will be paywalled and it will be more difficult to build 3rd party applications that rely on or improve upon these platforms. 3 Global Information ExchangeAs a whole, the Internet may be less open. Geography-based censorship could be more common. The more fragmented the Internet is, the easier it will be for websites to monitor and control access. This may even occur on a country-wide scale. It's nothing new for countries to control the internet access of their citizens. We have already seen the United States debating whether or not to ban TikTok. 4) The Original Vision of the InternetThe inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, believed in making humanity's knowledge open and accessible to all. However, with the proposed changes to Search and the potential for global internet fractures, AI is the exception to having free access to information. Though they're backed by and created for humans, AI models will only be as good as the information they can afford to accumulate and maintain. These changes move the profit-focused bottom line front and center and put the vision of a free, open, and accessible internet directly in the hands of market forces. What was originally dreamed up as a leap forward in human knowledge may exist only in the delicate balance between AI companies and the organizations that hold the keys to content, news, and information. Predicting the future of software development Over the next decade(s), generative AI will become increasingly prevalent across various industries. What does this mean for developers? It may be able to help us write code, but it can't imagine creatively and it can't do problem-solving for us. In other words, it won't replace developer jobs anytime soon — in fact, it will bring more work our way. Moving forward, AI experiences will have to be integrated into every application in the world. AI will be under the hood to enhance features that help streamline simple tasks for us. For instance, autocomplete will get more effective, and Excel sheets may be able to respond to human input instead of formulas. Applications that haven't seen major changes in decades — like word processors — can now open up to various improvements with AI. These AI enhancements will have to be built into applications by developers. With that, it's an exciting time to be a developer. If you haven't already added AI and ML technologies to your toolkit, now is an opportune time to do so. Check out our courses Become a Machine Learning Engineer and Zero to Hero in Python for Machine Learning. Whether or not you're a developer, knowing how to leverage generative AI can improve your productivity and career prospects. But this requires a unique skill: prompt engineering. By learning how to provide the proper context, constraints, and more, you can get the results you want out of tools like ChatGPT. Our new AI-assisted courses can help you master this yourself: All You Need to Know About Prompt Engineering. We're living in unprecedented times. While some of the changes can be jarring, I hope you take the opportunity to evolve with technology — there has never been a better (or more lucrative) time to develop AI skills.

Behind the glitz and glamour of the stage lies a rich tapestry of traditions and beliefs that have been passed down through generations of performers, directors, and stagehands. These theater superstitions add an air of mystery and intrigue to an already captivating world. Join us as we explore the meaning and origins behind ten intriguing theater superstitions.BREAK A LEG - The phrase Break a Leg is a well-known theatrical superstition used to wish performers good luck. Interestingly, it is considered bad luck to wish someone good luck directly before a performance. The origin of this phrase is subject to debate, but one plausible theory is that it dates back to ancient Greece when audiences would stomp their feet instead of clapping to show appreciation. A successful performance would result in so much stomping that an actor might break a leg. Additionally, some believe it could be a way to confuse or trick malevolent spirits who might be listening.THE GHOST LIGHT - The Ghost Light is a single, bare light bulb left on the stage when the theater is empty. Its purpose is to ward off spirits or ghosts that might inhabit the theater. This superstition has roots in practicality as well, ensuring that anyone entering the darkened theater can avoid accidents and tripping over props or set pieces. The light also serves as a symbol of hope, guiding lost spirits away from the stage.AVOIDING SAYING MACBETH IN A THEATRE - Calling the Shakespearean play Macbeth by its name inside a theater is considered extremely bad luck. Instead, it is referred to as The Scottish Play. The superstition has several origin stories, with one suggesting that uttering the name invites evil spirits and disastrous mishaps upon the production. Another theory links the curse to historical accidents and unfortunate events that occurred during various performances of the play.BAD DRESS REHEARSAL = GOOD PERFORMANCE - This superstition suggests that a less-than-stellar dress rehearsal is a positive sign for the actual performance. The underlying idea is that expending all the energy and perfection during the dress rehearsal leaves little for the real performance. Therefore, a flawed rehearsal implies a more energetic and successful opening night.AVOIDING BLUE COSTUMES - Wearing the color blue on stage is believed to bring bad luck to actors. Historically, blue dye was expensive and rare, and dressing an actor in blue implied a level of importance to their character. If the character then faced misfortune or death, the superstition emerged that the color blue was cursed.PEACOCK FEATHERS, MIRRORS, REAL MONEY, AND JEWELRY - Peacock feathers, mirrors, real money, and real jewelry are all considered unlucky on stage. Peacock feathers have been associated with the evil eye and are believed to bring disaster to a production. Mirrors, real money, and jewelry can reflect or attract negative energies, disrupting the harmony of the performance.WHISTLING IN THE THEATER - Whistling in a theater is thought to bring bad luck due to its historical association with scene changes. In the past, stagehands communicated using whistles during scene shifts. Whistling at random times could lead to miscommunication and potential accidents on stage.SLEEPING WITH A SCRIPT UNDER YOUR PILLOW - The superstition of sleeping with a script under one's pillow is believed to help actors memorize their lines better. Some also think it may invite good luck for a successful performance. This practice is likely rooted in the idea that dreams can reinforce memory.FLOWERS AFTER A PERFORMANCE - Giving flowers to performers after a show is considered good luck and a gesture of appreciation. Presenting flowers before the performance is thought to bring bad luck, possibly originating from the association of flowers with funerals and death.NEVER LIGHT A TRIO OF CANDLES - Theatrical superstition discourages lighting three candles on or offstage. This superstition likely stems from the fear of fire hazards or the idea that groups of three are often linked to bad luck in various cultural beliefs.Theater superstitions are a fascinating blend of historical traditions, practicality, and the human desire to understand and control the unpredictable nature of live performances. Whether based on historical accidents, practical considerations, or supernatural beliefs, these superstitions continue to be passed down from one generation of theater practitioners to the next, adding an extra layer of mystique to the world of theater. While some may dismiss them as mere old wives' tales, these beliefs are an integral part of the theater's rich and enchanting heritage.ShareShows You Should KnowChristmas in July: Plays and Musicals to Consider for your 2023 Holiday ShowAs the sun shines brightly and the warm summer breeze dances around us, it may feel a bit peculiar to start entertaining thoughts of snowflakes and sleigh rides.

However, when the value of truth, honesty, and love is learned, the Christmas spirit becomes the true winner in this heartwarming new holiday classic.The Best Christmas Pageant Ever: The Musical by Jahnna Beecham and Malcolm HillgartnerThe Story: The Herdmans are the worst kids in the history of the world–so when they crash Sunday school and demand parts in the Christmas pageant, the whole town panics.

"Twitter's in the news again. Here's what engineers need to know.Twitter's in the news again. Let's deep dive into Twitter's system architecture, and evaluate Elon Musk's proposed changes. Twitter is in the news… again. In case you missed the rapid fire dialogue and hot takes, I'll recap it all briefly here. Twitter surged back into mainstream news three weeks ago when Elon Musk announced that they were introducing strict (albeit temporary) daily limits on the amount of posts that users could load. New unverified accounts were initially limited to 300 posts per day, older unverified accounts got 600 posts per day, and verified accounts (i.e. those paying for Twitter Blue) were allotted 6,000 posts per day. Initially imposed to help suss out and eliminate problematic bot activity, these limits have since increased (or been removed entirely in some cases), and do not pose any significant limitations on real, human users. Shortly following this period of rocky social perception, parent company, Meta, announced its new standalone app, Threads. Threads directly resembles Twitter, both in UI and general features. One advantage that Threads offers however, is giving users the opportunity to link to their Instagram account so they can transfer their followers. Threads saw impressive signups in the first week, but its daily active users plummeted as people didn't fully jump ship from Twitter. That brings us to today. Just this week, Elon announced that Twitter is rebranding itself as X. Beyond new logos and design language it is unclear what else this transition entails. Though Musk has long had a vision of one app for everything: social connections, multimedia messaging, marketplace/payment processing, etc. Given that he has referred to this one stop shop for all things digital media as the X app, this recent rebranding may mark the beginning of a very long chain of events for Twitter. All of this conversation surrounding the branding, leadership, and the direction of the platform has resurfaced my interest in Twitter's underlying technical system. Shortly after Elon took ownership of Twitter in the fall of 2022, I did a deep dive into the architecture of Twitter and the main problems that the system faces when generating timelines. I think this is worth revisiting, especially when we consider that Twitter is still undergoing lots of rapid changes with reduced staff. It is unclear what product changes are on the horizon for Twitter, but it may be helpful to understand the system behind it all before we look too far ahead. Let's dive in!Want to understand what goes on behind the scenes in the world's largest scalable systems? Get hands-on with System Design — including functional & non-functional requirements, high-level & detailed design, and distinctive features of systems including Twitter, YouTube, and Uber — in our popular course: Grokking the Modern System Design Interview for Engineers & ManagersPreview CourseUnderstanding Twitter's Timeline The Timeline Mixer is Twitter’s existing service for curating the content users see in their timelines. It was created back when Twitter shifted towards algorithm-based timelines instead of reverse-chronological order timelines to serve content that would be more relevant to the user. Any data points that make up the user experience, including ads, tweets, recommended users, and pagination cursors, are contained within the timeline view. The Timeline Mixer called on three services:People Discovery: Provides users with recommendations on who to follow. This service looks at who you already follow, and what tweets you engage with or look at. Based on all that, it tries to recommend accounts that are relevant to your interests. Ad Mixer: Responsible for curating which ads are shown in your timeline based on a relevancy score. Onboarding: Provides an onboarding workflow for new users to follow so they can have a positive experience from the get-go.The new Home Ranker works similarly to the Timeline Mixer. You have a group of ads, tweets, and users. Out of this pool of candidates, you want to select the most relevant ones to be shown to the user. By looking at Elon’s diagram, we can also get a general idea of how these candidate sources are generated, scored, and ranked. If we look towards the bottom right, we can see how the Home Ranker fetches candidates that rank the highest based on different parameters, such as what hashtags they follow (Utag), which spaces they follow (Spaces), and what the user likes. Once the Prediction Service generates an overall score for the candidate source based on said parameters, it's sent back to the Home Mixer. Above the diagram for the candidate sources, we can see the process they use for feature hydration, which further optimizes performance. With feature hydration, you're essentially populating the candidate sources with additional data that allows the Timeline Mixer or Home Ranker to score them more accurately, and better serve relevant content to the user. Manhattan is Twitter’s general-purpose real-time distributed key-value store that stores the backend for Tweets, Twitter accounts, direct messages, and so on. Manhattan uses RocksDB as a storage engine responsible for storing and retrieving data within a particular node. Memcache is Twitter’s cache. If a tweet is recent, it is cached. Twitter can serve requests much more quickly if they don't need to reach into the database layer, in this case, Manhattan, to hydrate candidate sources if that data is already available in Memcache. Now that we've covered the major components of the current read path and talked a bit about how Twitter achieves its impressive speed, let's look at the changes to its read path. Home Mixer: Proposed system to replace the current timeline service (TLS) Services that Home Mixer calls:Manhattan: Twitter's internally-developed, real-time, distributed key-value store that stores the backend for Tweets, Twitter accounts, direct messages, and so on.Gizmoduck: Twitter's User API uses Gizmoduck to store user profiles.Social Graph: A model of their social network, similar to Facebook's TAO, is stored on FlocksDB, a distributed graph database.Tweety Pie: A tweet object used by the Tweet API.The read path is a critical component of Twitter's core services and is responsible for delivering content that users will view on their Twitter timelines. Not only is it where the majority of user interactions take place, it's also used to follow events in real time.Latency sensitivity is a key factor in delivering content quickly and effectively, so Twitter relies heavily on caching to handle hundreds of petabytes of data each day. As users interact with the timeline, data is swiftly retrieved from the server and stored in memory. Why low-latency mattersTwitter's beginning as a reverse chronological wall of tweets has now morphed into a much more data-intensive system. As mentioned above, the mixing services generate timelines of tweets, ads, and social recommendations based on multiple ranking heuristics. Despite this, Twitter still needs to serve timelines quickly. Alongside the typical non-functional requirements of a large social media platform (consistency, availability, reliability, and scalability), users expect new tweets to be served to their timelines in near real-time. When a breaking news story is developing, a media event is ongoing, or there's a new meme, people converge on Twitter. The phrase live-tweet describes this platform-unique idea of a real-time stream of consciousness covering a relevant topic.There are several ways that Twitter streamlines this process. Cached tweets can be retrieved quickly, but the system is able to provide an even better user experience by prioritizing tweets sent by accounts that you follow. By serving tweets from accounts that you follow first, the system can appear like a digital version of a real-world social space. How will these changes improve Twitter's architecture?The most important part of the Twitter user experience is browsing. Because of this, Twitter can make itself quite resilient. By making and storing copies of tweets, Twitter can ensure that it can always serve tweets for reading purposes. This is common across large-scale distributed systems, and not something that is new to Twitter. As one of the largest distributed social media systems in the world, Twitter is no stranger to making itself partition-tolerant and highly available. The most data-intensive, and budgetarily expensive, service provided by Twitter is building timelines. This cost is the current focus of many Twitter engineers. The old Timeline mixer service is being replaced with a significantly faster and simpler Home Mixer. In response to Twitter user @alexxubytes, Elon Musk claimed that the new Home Mixer service would be up to 10 times faster than the old system. There is very little information publicly available as to how the new system will be faster, but a while back Elon tweeted that the current Timeline mixer is slow because of 1000s of remote procedure calls. In the diagram, you can see that the Timeline Mixer talks to the Timeline Scorer through Thrift remote procedure calls. Thrift is a communication protocol that is known to be fairly slow because of its method of serializing and deserializing data structures. In the past, I was able to gain 10x or even 20x improvements in speed by removing Thrift and implementing static data structures where memory can be quickly type cast. My best guess is that the HomeRanker will be key in achieving this increase in speed. With quicker protocols and potentially some other tweaks, it's definitely possible that Twitter can reach its goal of 10x faster timelines. This significant increase in speed will greatly improve Twitter. Speed can help in multiple ways:The system can support significantly more concurrent users without dips in performance.Lower computational work reduces operating costs.Much of this Twitter redesign is likely centered around Musk seeking to save on infrastructure costs. At first glance, this could seem like irresponsible cost-cutting. Spending significantly less on server costs could be a real problem if the system isn't prepared to run without the backup it's historically had. That said, if Twitter is able to serve users as fast as Elon hopes, then they will be able to dramatically reduce spending.Get Hands-on with the World's Largest Distributed Systems I hope you enjoyed this Twitter architecture deep dive. Twitter is an impressive application, but the reality is that you need many talented engineers to keep such a massive system operating smoothly. There are very real risks when you attempt to implement significant changes to the architecture, all while cutting costs by $1B and attempting to keep the lights on with 80% fewer engineers. To put it simply: Twitter is resilient, but it isn’t invincible. One more thing to note: when systems of this scale get shut down, it is never easy to bring them back. Systems like Twitter are built to withstand the strain of several machines going down. But if you happen to lose the wrong server at the wrong time, it could take weeks to bring the whole system back online. Think of it like fracturing a bone. The injury could happen in a split second, but it could take weeks or even months for the body to fully heal. As the engineers at Twitter understand, there can be significant business consequences to an outage of this scale. An outage can trigger a series of cascading failures, leading to lost advertising revenue, harmed credibility, and beyond. In the meantime, if you want to dive deeper into Twitter’s System Design, I highly recommend our popular course: Grokking the Modern System Design Interview for Engineers & Managers (where we even have an entire case study dedicated to Twitter). You can also check out Grokking the Machine Learning Interview, especially the lesson on Tweet Selection (which dives into Twitter’s feed generation algorithm). Thanks for reading. I plan to share more in-depth System Design case studies soon!Happy learning!

To get more out of your efforts and your time, ask yourself these questions. 1What have I learned before? Think about your past projects and experiences. Focus on what went well, what motivated you along the way, and how this can help you now. 2What did I learn today? Even when we’re not taking a course, we still learn through everyday activities and interactions. Reflect on your day and anything you’d want to improve. 3What should I learn next? Based on your takeaways from the last two questions, decide which skills you should learn now to reach the next step in your journey. Remember, progress makes perfect.

Back-to-school season is a crucial time for theatre educators to set the tone for the rest of the year and create a nurturing and creative environment for their students. Here are ten practical back-to-school tips for theatre teachers to ensure a successful and fulfilling year ahead.Establish Clear Goals and Expectations: At the beginning of the school year, take the time to set clear goals and expectations for your theatre department. Outline what students can expect to learn, the projects they'll be working on, and the standards of behavior and dedication you expect from them. This will provide a sense of structure and direction for both you and your students throughout the year.Create a Safe and Inclusive Space: Theatre is all about self-expression and vulnerability, so it's crucial to create a safe and inclusive space for all students. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among classmates. Foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable taking creative risks and sharing their ideas without fear of judgment.Plan Engaging Icebreaker Activities: Icebreaker activities can help break down barriers and create a sense of camaraderie among students. Incorporate fun and engaging icebreaker games that allow students to get to know one another, as well as activities that spark their creativity and imagination.Assess Students' Skill Levels: At the beginning of the school year, assessing your students' skill levels is essential to tailor your lesson plans accordingly. This will help you understand where each student stands regarding acting, singing, dancing, or technical skills. Individualized attention and support can go a long way in fostering their growth and development.Build a Strong Team: Forming a solid production team is vital for your theatre productions. Recruit students interested in backstage roles, stage managers, designers, and technicians. A reliable and cohesive team will ensure your shows run smoothly and efficiently.Introduce Theatre History and Literature: Take the opportunity to introduce your students to theatre's rich history and literature. Teach them about influential playwrights, significant theatrical movements, and iconic performances. Understanding the roots of theatre can help students develop a deeper appreciation for the art form and inspire their creativity.Encourage Creative Exploration: Allow your students to explore their creativity freely. Provide opportunities for improvisation, scriptwriting, and character development exercises. Encouraging creative exploration nurtures their artistic talents and empowers them to discover their unique voices as performers.Organize Theatre Visits and Workshops: Organize trips to local theatres or invite professionals from the industry to conduct workshops. Exposing your students to live performances and industry experts can be highly inspiring and educational, giving them real-world insights into the world of theatre.Offer Constructive Feedback: As theatre teachers, your feedback is invaluable to students' growth. Provide regular, constructive feedback on their performances and projects. Focus on both strengths and areas for improvement, fostering a growth mindset that encourages them to strive for excellence.Celebrate Achievements: Celebrate your students' achievements throughout the year, no matter how big or small. Applaud their efforts and hard work in rehearsals, performances, and any extracurricular theatre-related activities. Recognizing their accomplishments boosts their confidence and reinforces their passion for theatre.In conclusion, back-to-school season sets the stage for an exciting and transformative journey in the world of theatre. By implementing these practical tips, theatre teachers can create a supportive and enriching environment that nurtures their students' creativity, fosters their talents, and instills a lifelong love for the performing arts. Together, teachers and students can embark on a rewarding theatrical adventure that will leave lasting impressions and fond memories for years to come.SharePLAYSCRIPTS FREE READS | JULY 2023Playscripts is proud to provide readers of The Scene with a selection of plays to read for free for July.

"Ace the System Design Interview with this tactic that works for every problemWant to learn how to solve any System Design problem with one simple 8-step approach? Look no further than RESHADED. Want to learn how to solve any System Design problem? Start here. Today we're zeroing in on System Design basics that every developer should know. I hear from engineers that System Design Interviews are usually the most daunting part of the interview loop. But with the right preparation, you can actually separate yourself from the pack with your System Design Interview. I want to break down the 8-step RESHADED approach that will help you solve any System Design Interview question. This is how we’d tackle design challenges back in my days as a systems engineer at Facebook and Microsoft, but this technique will still work even if you don’t have firsthand experience designing large scale distributed systems.I’ll also share a short video tutorial that I put together with help from the technical content team here at Educative. I love talking about all things System Design, so I hope you enjoy this and take away some useful insights.Check out the full tutorial on YouTube!Watch on YouTubeAt the end of the day, anyone will benefit from learning these basics. Developing a working knowledge of System Design will serve you as a junior or senior software engineer, engineering leader, or technical product manager. Let’s dive in!The 8-step RESHADED approach to System Design RESHADED was designed to be a quick and scalable approach to modern system design that doesn’t overwhelm you with low-level details. It will help you grok the full system, from hardware and software prerequisites all the way to the final user interaction.I go into more detail in the video, but to quickly recap, RESHADED stands for: 1) RequirementsUnderstand and define the boundaries of the system. 2) EstimationGauge the scale and size the system will need to handle. 3) Storage SchemaDecide how and where data will be stored and retrieved. 4) High-level DesignSketch an overall blueprint of how the system will function. 5) API DesignDefine how the system will interact with other components. 6) Detailed DesignDive deeper into each component and flesh out the specifics. 7) EvaluationTest your design, identify flaws and areas of improvement. 8) Distinctive Component or FeatureHighlight a unique aspect of your design that sets it apart.Following RESHADED ensures that you cover all bases when tackling System Design problems. But remember, you will need to get to a level where you can comfortably talk through your decision-making process and defend any tradeoffs in your design that you make. Your interviewer's main objective is to evaluate your comprehension of the system you're creating, rather than delve too deeply into the specifics of individual elements. Employing the RESHADED technique, you'll be able to guide your interviewer smoothly through the whole system and respond to any questions they might pose.In addition, it’s important to develop a working knowledge of modern System Design principles and building blocks like load balancing, data partitioning, indexes, and caches. To help you apply these principles in practice, we have a boilerplate high level design that can serve as a starting point for most System Design problems:Want to see RESHADED in action?I've created a step-by-step tutorial video on YouTube where I walk through each of these elements in detail. The video will provide a practical demonstration of how to apply the RESHADED approach — including through a few real-world System Design Interview questions. Sharpening your System Design skills can separate yourself from the pack and position you well for success in the interview and beyond. I hope these resources help you on your journey.Happy learning!

Announces Six Winning Plays by Emerging Teen Writers on Ending Gun Violence ENOUGH! Plays to End Gun Violence has announced this year’s winners of its national short play competition. Six impactful plays tackling the subject of gun violence were selected, representing the creative voices of teen playwrights from across the country. The plays and playwrights chosen for this year's competition are:The Smiles Behind by Niarra C. Bell from VirginiaA Call for Help by Pepper Fox from KentuckyrOunds by HJ Kennedy from North CarolinaA Disorderly House by Sam Lee Victor from New JerseyNo Prospering Weapons by Justin Cameron Washington from MichiganThe Matter at Hand by Valentine Wulf from WashingtonLed by the visionary creator and Joaquin Oliver Artistic Producer Michael Cotey, the ENOUGH! initiative empowers teenagers to confront the issue of gun violence by crafting original theatrical works that foster critical conversations and inspire tangible action within their communities. The winning plays will debut on November 6, 2023, at The Kennedy Center's Theater Lab in Washington, D.C. This highly anticipated event will serve as the cornerstone of a series of readings taking place nationwide on the same evening. The collaborative effort, spearheaded by Event Producer Shanara Gabrielle and supported by the Kennedy Center Social Impact and Kennedy Center Education, will involve renowned professional theaters such as Signature Theatre, Arena Stage, Round House Theatre, Imagination Stage, Olney Theatre Center, 1st Stage, The Theatre Lab, and Mosaic Theater.Great art enables us to gain fresh perspectives on the human condition, and these young theater makers are truly inspiring as they employ their unique voices to shed light on the epidemic of gun violence, remarked Marc Bamuthi Joseph, the Kennedy Center Vice President, and Artistic Director of Social Impact.This year marks the third edition of ENOUGH!, which has received over 500 short play submissions from teenage writers addressing the issue of gun violence. The previous Nationwide Readings organized by ENOUGH! in 2020 and 2022 involved more than 100 organizations and engaged nearly 2,000 artists, ultimately reaching over 10,000 individuals. The initiative has garnered international attention, with coverage by esteemed press outlets including PBS NewsHour, NPR, and the BBC. Furthermore, ENOUGH! has been honored with the prestigious Goldin Foundation Exemplary Project Award.During the spring, ENOUGH! received an impressive total of 244 submissions from 36 states, inviting teenagers to create 10-minute plays focused on gun violence. Esteemed dramatists Idris Goodwin, Lauren Gunderson, Zora Howard, Samuel D. Hunter, David Henry Hwang, Octavio Solis, and Lloyd Suh, recognized nationally for their contributions to the field, carefully selected this year's winning plays. Each playwright awarded will receive a $500 stipend sponsored by the gun violence prevention organization Change the Ref. Additionally, their plays will be published and licensed through the Broadway Licensing Group’s Playscripts imprint, and they will gain membership in The Dramatists Guild, providing access to valuable training and resources.David Henry Hwang, a returning panelist judge and acclaimed playwright known for his Tony Award-winning work M. Butterfly and the Pulitzer Prize finalist musical Soft Power, expressed his admiration for the submissions: The quality of this year's entries was truly remarkable, both in terms of artistic merit and the diverse range of stories and communities represented. These talented and inspiring young dramatists remind us once again that our nation needs their voices to declare 'ENOUGH!' to the scourge of gun violence.ENOUGH! is committed to making the winning plays accessible and will offer them for free during the Nationwide Reading on November 6. Schools, theaters, and community organizations of all sizes are invited to stage local readings of these powerful works. Producers of these regional readings are encouraged to seize this opportunity to forge meaningful partnerships and incorporate community engagement components that address the specific realities of gun violence in their areas.These plays provide a profound glimpse into the perspective of a generation that has grown up with the pervasive threat of gun violence, even within the confines of their educational institutions, highlighted ENOUGH! creator Michael Cotey. By staging these plays nationwide precisely one year ahead of the next presidential election, we urgently remind everyone that gun violence remains a pressing issue for the young voters who will be coming of age next November.ENOUGH!'s ultimate goal is to see that every state hosts a reading of the winning plays.
