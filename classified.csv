The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.Conditions of CarriageAir transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example:• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.• Our right to change terms of the contract.• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight.These terms are incorporated by reference into our contract with you. You may view these conditions of carriage on delta.com, or by requesting a copy from Delta.You have received this email because you elected to receive your Electronic Ticket receipt sent to you via email.

The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.Conditions of CarriageAir transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example:• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.• Our right to change terms of the contract.• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight.These terms are incorporated by reference into our contract with you. You may view these conditions of carriage on delta.com, or by requesting a copy from Delta.You have received this email because you elected to receive your Electronic Ticket receipt sent to you via email. If you would like to take advantage of other Delta email programs featuring special fares, promotions, information and flight updates, please visit: delta.com/emailprograms or delta.com/notifications.This document establishes the creation of your electronic EMD(S) in our computer systems.

These terms and conditions may be provided separately or may be obtained from the issuing agent. Effective December 15, 2019, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada:If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. For more information about your passenger rights please contact your air carrier (www.delta.com/appr) or visit the Canadian Transportation Agency’s website.

As a reminder, your bank requires this security measure for your card ending in 4005. Confirm payment Why do you need to confirm this payment? Your bank sometimes requires an additional step to make sure an online transaction was authorized. Your bank uses Visa Secure to set a higher security standard and protect you from fraud. Because of regulation to protect consumers, many online payments now require two-factor authentication. Your bank ultimately decides when authentication is required to confirm a payment, but you may notice this step when you start paying for a service or when the cost changes.
